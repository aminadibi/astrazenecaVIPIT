## Abstract

  **Background:** Recently, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended against using the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in younger adults pending further review of the risk for Vaccine-Induced Prothrombotic Immune Thrombocytopenia (VIPIT). As a result, the province of British Columbia halted its front-line workers vaccination program which used the AstraZeneca vaccine. The province is expected to receive an additional 246,700 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine through US and COVAX until April 11th, enough to provide the first dose of vaccine to all unvaccinated front-line workers. It is unclear whether mRNA vaccines can be immediately made available to front-line workers. We evaluated the harms and benefits of delaying vaccination of front-line workers in BC. 
  
  **Methods:** We reviewed the latest available evidence and used compartmental modelling to *a)* compare the expected number of mortality due to COVID-19 and VIPIT under the scenarios of immediately continuing vaccination of front-line workers with the AstraZeneca vaccine or delaying it in favour of mRNA vaccines, and *b)* compare the mortality risk of immediately receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine and delaying vaccination at a personal level for different age groups. 
  
  **Results:** We estimate that if British Columbia immediately continues the front-line worker vaccination program with the AstraZeneca vaccine, we expect to see no VIPIT-related deaths, about 40,000 fewer cases of COVID-19, 750 fewer hospitalizations, 180 fewer COVID-related deaths, and 2,150 fewer cases of Long COVID.
  
  **Conclusions:** The benefits of immediately continuing immunization of front-line workers with AstraZeneca far outweigh the risk both at a societal level and at a personal level for recipients over 30 years old.
