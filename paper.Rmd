## Background

Recently, NACI recommended against using AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine for Canadians under the age 55, due to concerns about the incidence of Vaccine-Induced Prothrombotic Immune Thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) based on European reports [@national_advisory_committee_on_immunization_naci_naci_2021]. On Match 18, 2021, the European Medicines Agency estimated the incidence of VIPID at approximately 1 per 1,000,000 people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine [@european_medicines_agency_covid-19_2021]. A higher estimated rate of 1 per 100,000 by the Paul-Ehrlich Institut in Germany was published on March 19th [@paul-ehrlich-institut_pei_covid-19_2021]. It was this higher rate reported by the Paul-Ehrlich Institut that led NACI to recommend against using this vaccine in adults under 55 years old [@national_advisory_committee_on_immunization_naci_naci_2021]. On April 1st, the UK Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency updated its own previously reported data to report a total of 22 cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and 8 other clot-related events from 18.1 million doses of the AstraZeneca Vaccine.

## Harm-Benefit Analysis

We need to assess whether mortality risk due to AstraZeneca is larger than or comparable to the risk of mortality due to COVID-19. 

### Mortality Risk due to AstraZeneca Vaccine

$$
P(death)_{astrazeneca}  = P(VIPIT|AZ) \times P(death|VIPIT)
$$

To err on the side of caution, we will follow NACI's lead and assume the highest reported rate of VIPIT, which is 1 in 100,000 recipients, so $P(VIPIT|AZ) = \frac{1}{100,000}$. On the other hand, as reported by NACI, case fatality due to VIPID is currently estimated at 40%, but is likely to decrease as there will be more awareness and better early treatment. Again to err on the side of caution, we'll keep the estimate at 40%, so

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(death)_{astrazeneca} & = \frac{1}{100,000} \times \frac{40}{100} \\
& = \frac{4}{1,000,000}
\end{aligned}
$$
So, the risk of death due to AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is approximately 2 in 1 million vaccine eligible population. The population of BC under 50 years old is approximately 2 million. Assuming an 80% uptake for all COVID-19 vaccines combined and that half of vaccine recipients will receive the AstraZeneca vaccine, we can estimate the expected number of deaths in BC

$$
\begin{aligned}
E(death)_{astrazeneca} & = 2,000,000 \, \text{persons} \times \frac{80\small{\text{ vaccinated}} }{100\small{\text{ persons}}} \times \frac{1\small{\text{ vaccinated with AZ}}}{2\small{\text{ vaccinated}}} \times \frac{4\small{\text{ deaths}}}{1,000,000\small{\text{ vaccinated with AZ}}} \\
& = 3.2 \text{ deaths}
\end{aligned}
 $$

### Mortality Risk due to COVID-19 

Now let's calculate the mortality risk in BC during COVID.
