	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 1964, The Melbourne Asthma Study was established to describe the spectrum and natural history of childhood asthma.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and lung function outcome of childhood asthma to the age of 50 years.
METHOD: Subjects were invited to complete an interviewer-administered questionnaire, skin prick testing, and measurement of lung function from the age of 7 years to the age of 50 years at 7-year intervals.
RESULTS: Of 458 survivors (from the original 484 subjects at recruitment), 346 subjects (76\%) participated, of whom, 197 completed lung function measurement. Asthma remission at the age of 50 years was 64\% in those with wheezy bronchitis, 47\% for those with persistent asthma, and 15\% for those with severe asthma in childhood. Multivariable analysis identified severe asthma in childhood (odds ratio [OR] 11.9 [95\% CI, 3.4-41.8]), female sex (OR 2.0 [95\% CI, 1.1-3.6]), and childhood hay fever (OR 2.0 [95\% CI, 1.0-4.0]) as risk factors for "current asthma" at age 50 years. There was no evidence of a difference in the rate of decline in FEV1 (mL/y, 95\% CI) between the severe asthma group (15 mL/y [95\% CI, 9-22 mL/y]) and all the other recruitment groups: control (16 mL/y [95\% CI, 12-20 mL/y]), mild wheezy bronchitis (14 mL/y [95\% CI, 8-19 mL/y]), wheezy bronchitis (16 mL/y [95\% CI, 11-20 mL/y]), and persistent asthma (19 mL/y [95\% CI, 13-24 mL/y]).
CONCLUSION: The clinical and lung function outcome in adult life is strongly determined by asthma severity in childhood. The reduced lung function seen in adults is established in childhood and does not appear to decline more rapidly in adult years despite continuing symptoms.},

Design Systematic review.
Data sources Medline and Embase until June 2013.
Eligibility criteria for study selection Studies describing the development or external validation of a multivariable model for predicting CVD risk in the general population.
Results 9965 references were screened, of which 212 articles were included in the review, describing the development of 363 prediction models and 473 external validations. Most models were developed in Europe (n=167, 46\%), predicted risk of fatal or non-fatal coronary heart disease (n=118, 33\%) over a 10 year period (n=209, 58\%). The most common predictors were smoking (n=325, 90\%) and age (n=321, 88\%), and most models were sex specific (n=250, 69\%). Substantial heterogeneity in predictor and outcome definitions was observed between models, and important clinical and methodological information were often missing. The prediction horizon was not specified for 49 models (13\%), and for 92 (25\%) crucial information was missing to enable the model to be used for individual risk prediction. Only 132 developed models (36\%) were externally validated and only 70 (19\%) by independent investigators. Model performance was heterogeneous and measures such as discrimination and calibration were reported for only 65\% and 58\% of the external validations, respectively.
Conclusions There is an excess of models predicting incident CVD in the general population. The usefulness of most of the models remains unclear owing to methodological shortcomings, incomplete presentation, and lack of external validation and model impact studies. Rather than developing yet another similar CVD risk prediction model, in this era of large datasets, future research should focus on externally validating and comparing head-to-head promising CVD risk models that already exist, on tailoring or even combining these models to local settings, and investigating whether these models can be extended by addition of new predictors.},

Study Design 7251 households in USA and Europe with at least one child aged 1–5 years were interviewed by telephone for recurrent days troubled by cough, wheeze or breathlessness during the recent 6 winter months. Results 9490 young children were identified, 32\% of whom were reported to suffer from recurrent days with troublesome cough, wheeze or breathlessness. Detailed interview with the 2700 mothers of the symptomatic children showed that 24\% of this interview population suffered weekly symptoms despite current treatment with considerable impact on lifestyle and healthcare resource use. Antibiotics, cough- and herbal-medications were the most commonly used treatments. Anti-asthmatic and anti-allergy agents were prescribed in the order: inhaled β2-agonists {\textgreater} inhaled corticosteroid {\textgreater} oral anti-histamines {\textgreater} oral corticosteroids. The reported symptom burden was higher in Southern Europe and there were pronounced regional differences in treatment and diagnostic terms. Conclusions Recurrent days with cough, wheeze or breathlessness in preschool children represents a major cause of morbidity in preschool children despite current treatment. There is a striking lack of international consensus on diagnosis and treatment. This uncontrolled morbidity highlights a significant unmet clinical need in preschool children.

	abstract = {Asthma is common and becoming more so in childhood. Although mild asthma may incur low average annual costs per child, these estimates need to be viewed in the context of the very large numbers of affected individuals. Whereas asthma and wheezing illness in childhood had in the past been broadly subdivided into asthma (often associated with atopy) and wheezy bronchitis (wheeze only, with associated upper respiratory tract infection), this distinction was lost during the 1970s in view of the demonstrated underdiagnosis and undertreatment of symptomatic school-age children. The acceptance of asthma as a chronic inflammatory disease and evidence for airway remodeling and progressive deterioration in airway function in association with symptoms and atopy have led to earlier use of topical steroids at higher starting doses delivered by improved age-appropriate devices. Treating all children as if they were destined to become atopic asthmatics and at risk of airway remodeling may not be rational, particularly in those whose symptoms will subsequently resolve. However, there are as yet no screening tests which can clearly identify individuals at risk of long-term chronic airway inflammation and airway remodeling. The large number of infants and young children with current symptoms suggestive of asthma and in whom resolution is likely in the majority poses problems for the clinician in deciding the best initial therapy. There is an urgent need to develop simple and reliable measures that can identify the early manifestations of atopic airway sensitisation and to establish the place of early intervention with nonsteroidal drugs, including leukotriene antigonists.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite remarkable advances in our understanding of asthma, there are still several unmet needs associated with the management of pediatric asthma.
METHODS: A two-day, face-to-face meeting was held in London, United Kingdom, on October 28 and 29, 2017, involving a group of international expert clinicians and scientists in asthma management to discuss the challenges and unmet needs that remain to be addressed in pediatric asthma.
RESULTS: These unmet needs include a lack of clinical efficacy and safety evidence, and limited availability of non-steroid-based alternative therapies in patients {\textless}6 years of age. An increased focus on children is needed in the context of clinical practice guidelines for asthma; current pediatric practice relies mostly on extrapolations from adult recommendations. Furthermore, no uniform definition of pediatric asthma exists, which hampers timely and robust diagnosis of the condition in affected patients.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for a uniform definition of pediatric asthma, clearly distinguishable from adult asthma. Furthermore, guidelines which provide specific treatment recommendations for the management of pediatric asthma are also needed. Clinical trials and real-world evidence studies assessing anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) therapies and other monoclonal antibodies in children {\textless}6 years of age with asthma may provide further information regarding the most appropriate treatment options in these vulnerable patients. Early intervention with anti-IgE and non-steroid-based alternative therapies may delay disease progression, leading to improved clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that is widespread throughout the US population and disproportionately affects children. This literature review aimed to identify recent information regarding the economic burden of pediatric asthma in the US. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Econlit, and PsycINFO databases and gray literature sources were searched from January 2012 to January 2018 to capture relevant publications. Publications reporting on healthcare resource utilization and/or healthcare costs of pediatric asthma were included (n = 8). Total direct costs of pediatric asthma were US\$5.92 billion in 2013. Average annual costs per child ranged from US\$3076 to US\$13612. Across studies, pharmacy (US\$1027–2120), inpatient (US\$337–2016) and outpatient (US\$1049–8039) costs were the primary contributors to healthcare costs. Inpatient and emergency department (ED) visits exerted a high economic burden. For instance, the national annual cost of asthma-related hospitalizations was estimated at US\$1.59 billion in 2009, while estimates of costs-per-hospitalization (2010) and charges-per-discharge (2009) were US\$3600 and US\$8406, respectively. The total cost of ED visits to Medicaid was estimated at US\$272 million in 2010. In a mixed-insurance population, ED cost estimates ranged from US\$152 to US\$172 annually per patient. Invariably, costs for children with asthma were significantly greater than for children without. Pediatric asthma imposes a significant economic burden to the US healthcare system. Children with asthma have significantly higher healthcare resource utilization and costs than children without asthma.},

	abstract = {Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children, imposing a consistent burden on health system. In recent years, prevalence of asthma symptoms became globally increased in children and adolescents, particularly in Low-Middle Income Countries (LMICs). Host (genetics, atopy) and environmental factors (microbial exposure, exposure to passive smoking and air pollution), seemed to contribute to this trend. The increased prevalence observed in metropolitan areas with respect to rural ones and, overall, in industrialized countries, highlighted the role of air pollution in asthma inception. Asthma accounts for 1.1\% of the overall global estimate of “Disability-adjusted life years” (DALYs)/100.000 for all causes. Mortality in children is low and it decreased across Europe over recent years. Children from LMICs particularly suffer a disproportionately higher burden in terms of morbidity and mortality. Global asthma-related costs are high and are usually are classified into direct, indirect and intangible costs. Direct costs account for 50-80\% of the total costs. Asthma is one of the main causes of hospitalization which are particularly common in children aged {\textless}5 years with a prevalence that has been increased during the last two decades, mostly in LMICs. Indirect costs are usually higher than in older patients, including both school and work-related losses. Intangible costs are unquantifiable, since they are related to impairment of quality of life, limitation of physical activities and study performance. The implementation of strategies aimed at early detect asthma thus providing access to the proper treatment has been shown to effectively reduce the burden of the disease.},

Subsequently, the adoption of such models by professionals must guide their decision-making, and improve patient outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of care. In the first paper of this series of two companion papers, issues relating to prediction model development, their internal validation, and estimating the added value of a new (bio)marker to existing predictors were discussed. In this second paper, an overview is provided of the consecutive steps for the assessment of the model's predictive performance in new individuals (external validation studies), how to adjust or update existing models to local circumstances or with new predictors, and how to investigate the impact of the uptake of prediction models on clinical decision-making and patient outcomes (impact studies).

	doi = {10.1111/jep.12895},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Contemporary delivery of health care is inappropriate in many ways, largely due to suboptimal Q5 decision-making. A typical approach to improve practitioners' decision-making is to develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPG) by guidelines panels, who are instructed to use their judgments to derive practice recommendations. However, mechanisms for the formulation of guideline judgments remains a "black-box" operation-a process with defined inputs and outputs but without sufficient knowledge of its internal workings.
METHODS: Increased explicitness and transparency in the process can be achieved by implementing CPG as clinical pathways (CPs) (also known as clinical algorithms or flow-charts). However, clinical recommendations thus derived are typically ad hoc and developed by experts in a theory-free environment. As any recommendation can be right (true positive or negative), or wrong (false positive or negative), the lack of theoretical structure precludes the quantitative assessment of the management strategies recommended by CPGs/CPs.
RESULTS: To realize the full potential of CPGs/CPs, they need to be placed on more solid theoretical grounds. We believe this potential can be best realized by converting CPGs/CPs within the heuristic theory of decision-making, often implemented as fast-and-frugal (FFT) decision trees. This is possible because FFT heuristic strategy of decision-making can be linked to signal detection theory, evidence accumulation theory, and a threshold model of decision-making, which, in turn, allows quantitative analysis of the accuracy of clinical management strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: Fast-and-frugal provides a simple and transparent, yet solid and robust, methodological framework connecting decision science to clinical care, a sorely needed missing link between CPGs/CPs and patient outcomes. We therefore advocate that all guidelines panels express their recommendations as CPs, which in turn should be converted into FFTs to guide clinical care.},

Samples of these records (n = 397) and records without these ICD-9 CM codes (n = 500) were reviewed, and clinical data were extracted. The accuracy of administrative data to identify and distinguish between Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism was calculated. A total of 37.9\% of parkinsonism cases were detected using pharmacy data and ICD-9 CM codes compared to 18.7\% by using ICD-9 CM codes alone. The ICD-9 CM code for paralysis agitans (332.0) did not distinguish between probable Parkinson's disease and other causes of parkinsonism, whereas the ICD-9 CM code for degenerative basal ganglia disorder (333.0) predicted having secondary parkinsonism (odds ratio [OR] = 5.0) as well as dopa-responsiveness in patients without secondary parkinsonism (OR = 4.5). Administrative data are limited in the ability to identify parkinsonism. The ICD-9 CM code, 332.0, which is generally considered the code to identify Parkinson's disease, did not distinguish between parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease.},

We examined the medical records, from 1998 to 2004, of 401 Los Angeles veterans with Parkinson's disease to determine whether care met key indicators of PD care quality. All care following a visit to a movement-disorder specialist or general neurologist was classified as specialty care. We compared adherence to each indicator by level of specialist involvement through logistic regression models. Over the study period, 10 indicators of PD care quality were triggered 2,227 times. Overall, movement disorder specialist involvement (78\%) was associated with higher adherence to indicators than did general neurologist involvement (70\%, P = 0.006) and nonneurologist involvement (52\%, P {\textless} 0.001). The differences between movement disorder specialist and nonneurologist involvement were especially large for four indicators: treatment of wearing-off, assessments of falls, depression, and hallucinations. There is significant room for improving aspects of PD care quality among patients who do not have the involvement of a specialist. Quality of care interventions should involve specialists in management of motor symptoms and incorporate methods for routine assessment of nonmotor PD symptoms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preserved Ratio Impaired Spirometry (PRISm), defined as a reduced FEV1 in the setting of a preserved FEV1/FVC ratio, is highly prevalent and is associated with increased respiratory symptoms, systemic inflammation, and mortality. Studies investigating quantitative chest tomographic features, genetic associations, and subtypes in PRISm subjects have not been reported.
METHODS: Data from current and former smokers enrolled in COPDGene (n = 10,192), an observational, cross-sectional study which recruited subjects aged 45-80 with ≥10 pack years of smoking, were analyzed. To identify epidemiological and radiographic predictors of PRISm, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses comparing PRISm subjects both to control subjects with normal spirometry and to subjects with COPD. To investigate common genetic predictors of PRISm, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS). To explore potential subgroups within PRISm, we performed unsupervised k-means clustering.
RESULTS: The prevalence of PRISm in COPDGene is 12.3\%. Increased dyspnea, reduced 6-minute walk distance, increased percent emphysema and decreased total lung capacity, as well as increased segmental bronchial wall area percentage were significant predictors (p-value {\textless}0.05) of PRISm status when compared to control subjects in multivariate models. Although no common genetic variants were identified on GWAS testing, a significant association with Klinefelter's syndrome (47XXY) was observed (p-value {\textless} 0.001). Subgroups identified through k-means clustering include a putative "COPD-subtype", "Restrictive-subtype", and a highly symptomatic "Metabolic-subtype".
CONCLUSIONS: PRISm subjects are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Future investigations into the pathophysiological mechanisms behind and potential treatment options for subgroups within PRISm are warranted.

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Increasing awareness of the prevalence and significance of Preserved Ratio Impaired Spirometry (PRISm), alternatively known as restrictive or Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)-unclassified spirometry, has expanded the body of knowledge on cross-sectional risk factors. However, longitudinal studies of PRISm remain limited.
OBJECTIVES: To examine longitudinal patterns of change in lung function, radiographic characteristics, and mortality of current and former smokers with PRISm.
METHODS: Current and former smokers, aged 45 to 80 years, were enrolled in COPDGene (phase 1, 2008-2011) and returned for a 5-year follow-up (phase 2, 2012-2016). Subjects completed questionnaires, spirometry, chest computed tomography scans, and 6-minute-walk tests at both study visits. Baseline characteristics, longitudinal change in lung function, and mortality were assessed by post-bronchodilator lung function categories: PRISm (FEV1/FVC {\textless} 0.7 and FEV1 {\textless} 80\%), GOLD0 (FEV1/FVC {\textgreater} 0.7 and FEV1 {\textgreater} 80\%), and GOLD1-4 (FEV1/FVC {\textless} 0.7).
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Although the prevalence of PRISm was consistent (12.4-12.5\%) at phases 1 and 2, subjects with PRISm exhibited substantial rates of transition to and from other lung function categories. Among subjects with PRISm at phase 1, 22.2\% transitioned to GOLD0 and 25.1\% progressed to GOLD1-4 at phase 2. Subjects with PRISm at both phase 1 and phase 2 had reduced rates of FEV1 decline (-27.3 ± 42.1 vs. -33.0 ± 41.7 ml/yr) and comparable proportions of normal computed tomography scans (51\% vs. 52.7\%) relative to subjects with stable GOLD0 spirometry. In contrast, incident PRISm exhibited accelerated rates of lung function decline. Subjects with PRISm at phase 1 had higher mortality rates relative to GOLD0 and lower rates relative to the GOLD1-4 group.
CONCLUSIONS: PRISm is highly prevalent, is associated with increased mortality, and represents a transitional state for significant subgroups of subjects. Additional studies to characterize longitudinal progression in PRISm are warranted.},

	abstract = {Significant heterogeneity of clinical presentation and disease progression exists within chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although FEV1 inadequately describes this heterogeneity, a clear alternative has not emerged. The goal of phenotyping is to identify patient groups with unique prognostic or therapeutic characteristics, but significant variation and confusion surrounds use of the term “phenotype” in COPD. Phenotype classically refers to any observable characteristic of an organism, and up until now, multiple disease characteristics have been termed COPD phenotypes. We, however, propose the following variation on this definition: “a single or combination of disease attributes that describe differences between individuals with COPD as they relate to clinically meaningful outcomes (symptoms, exacerbations, response to therapy, rate of disease progression, or death).” This more focused definition allows for classification of patients into distinct prognostic and therapeutic subgroups for both clinical and research purposes. Ideally, individuals sharing a unique phenotype would also ultimately be determined to have a similar underlying biologic or physiologic mechanism(s) to guide the development of therapy where possible. It follows that any proposed phenotype, whether defined by symptoms, radiography, physiology, or cellular or molecular fingerprint will require an iterative validation process in which “candidate” phenotypes are identified before their relevance to clinical outcome is determined. Although this schema represents an ideal construct, we acknowledge any phenotype may be etiologicaxlly heterogeneous and that any one individual may manifest multiple phenotypes. We have much yet to learn, but establishing a common language for future research will facilitate our understanding and management of the complexity implicit to this disease.},

	abstract = {Normal spirometry is often used to preclude airway disease in individuals with unspecific respiratory symptoms. We tested the hypothesis that chronic respiratory symptoms are associated with respiratory hospitalisations and death in individuals with normal spirometry without known airway disease.
We included 108 246 randomly chosen individuals aged 20–100 years from a Danish population-based cohort study. Normal spirometry was defined as a pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity ratio ≥0.70. Chronic respiratory symptoms included dyspnoea, chronic mucus hypersecretion, wheezing and cough. Individuals with known airway disease, i.e. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or asthma, were excluded (n=10 291). We assessed risk of hospitalisations due to exacerbations of airway disease and pneumonia, and respiratory and all-cause mortality, from 2003 through 2018.
52 999 individuals had normal spirometry without chronic respiratory symptoms and 30 890 individuals had normal spirometry with chronic respiratory symptoms. During follow-up, we observed 1037 hospitalisations with exacerbation of airway disease, 5743 hospitalisations with pneumonia and 8750 deaths, of which 463 were due to respiratory disease. Compared with individuals with normal spirometry without chronic respiratory symptoms, multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for individuals with normal spirometry with chronic respiratory symptoms were 1.62 (95\% CI 1.20–2.18) for exacerbation hospitalisations, 1.26 (95\% CI 1.17–1.37) for pneumonia hospitalisations, 1.59 (95\% CI 1.22–2.06) for respiratory mortality and 1.19 (95\% CI 1.13–1.25) for all-cause mortality. There was a positive dose–response relationship between number of symptoms and risk of outcomes. Results were similar after 2 years of follow-up, for never-smokers alone, and for each symptom separately.
Chronic respiratory symptoms are associated with respiratory hospitalisations and death in individuals with normal spirometry without known airway disease.

We used data from two large population-based European cohorts: 6698 European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) and 6069 Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA) adult participants. The restrictive pattern was defined as forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥lower limit of normal (LLN) and FVC {\textless}LLN; an obstructive pattern was defined as FEV1/FVC {\textless}LLN independent of FVC. The Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary of quality of life were computed using the Short Form-36 questionnaire.
In both cohorts, the restrictive pattern was associated with heavy smoking, being underweight or obese and the coexistence of respiratory symptoms. In univariate analyses, compared with the normal group, both the restrictive and obstructive pattern had significant Physical Component Summary deficits (−2.77 and −2.08, respectively, in ECRHS; −3.25 and −2.14, respectively, in SAPALDIA; all p-values {\textless}0.001). However, in models adjusted for sex, age, education, body mass index, smoking, comorbidities and respiratory symptoms, only the restrictive pattern remained significantly associated with Physical Component Summary deficits (p=0.004 in ECRHS; p=0.001 in SAPALDIA).
The restrictive spirometric pattern is associated with deficits in the physical component of quality of life that are partly independent of the presence of respiratory symptoms.

	abstract = {Patients with asthma–chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome (ACOS) have been largely excluded from pivotal therapeutic trials and, as a result, its treatment remains poorly defined and lacking firm evidence. To date, there is no universally accepted definition of ACOS, which has made it difficult to understand its epidemiology or pathophysiology. Despite many uncertainties, there is emerging agreement that some of the key features of ACOS include persistent airflow limitation in symptomatic individuals 40 years of age and older, a well-documented history of asthma in childhood or early adulthood and a significant exposure history to cigarette or biomass smoke. In this perspective, we propose a case definition of ACOS that incorporates these key features in a parsimonious algorithm that may enable clinicians to better diagnose patients with ACOS and most importantly enable researchers to design therapeutic and clinical studies to elucidate its epidemiology and pathophysiology and to ascertain its optimal management strategies.

	abstract = {Background: Computed tomographic (CT) measures of lung density are potential intermediate study endpoints for clinical studies but to do so, the clinical associations of these changes must be understood and benchmarked against accepted clinical endpoints such as change in lung function. We investigated the relationship between changes in lung density and FEV1 in smokers with and without COPD.
Methods: The 15th percentile of CT lung density was obtained from the scans of 3390 smokers who completed baseline and 5-yr follow-up COPDGene study visits. The relationship between the change in lung density and change in FEV1 was assessed using multivariable mixed models. Separate models were performed in smokers at risk, with PRISM (preserved ratio and impaired spirometry) smokers, and with COPD by GOLD stage.
Results: In smokers with PRISM an increase in lung density was significantly associated with a decrease in FEV1 (estimate per 1 g/L increase, -3.0 mL P=0.007). In contrast, in GOLD 3-4 COPD, there was a direct relationship between loss of lung density and loss of lung function. One g/L decrease in lung density was associated with a decrease of 4.8 mL FEV1 (P=0.0003) over the 5-yr follow-up.

Conclusion: A decline in lung density was associated with an increase or decrease in FEV1 based on disease severity. This FEV1-CT lung density relationship should be taken into account when using CT imaging as an endpoint in COPD longitudinal studies.},

More commonly, patients with uncharacterized breathlessness are treated with therapies that target asthma and COPD rather than one of these diseases. This common practice represents the difficulty in distinguishing these disorders clinically, particularly in patients with a history that does not easily differentiate asthma from COPD. A common clinical scenario is an older former smoker with partially reversible or fixed airflow obstruction and evidence of atopy, demonstrating "overlap" features of asthma and COPD. We stress that asthma-COPD overlap syndrome becomes more prevalent with advancing age as patients respond less favorably to guideline-recommended drug therapy. We review the similarities and differences in clinical characteristics between these disorders, and their physiologic and inflammatory profiles within the context of the aging patient. We underscore the difficulties in differentiating asthma from COPD in current or former smokers, share our institutional experience with overlap syndrome, and highlight the need for new research to better characterize and investigate this important clinical phenotype.},

	abstract = {Bone mineral density (BMD) is a strong predictor of fracture, yet most fractures occur in women without osteoporosis by BMD criteria. To improve fracture risk prediction, the World Health Organization recently developed a country-specific fracture risk index of clinical risk factors (FRAX) that estimates 10-year probabilities of hip and major osteoporotic fracture. Within differing baseline BMD categories, we evaluated 6252 women aged 65 or older in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures using FRAX 10-year probabilities of hip and major osteoporotic fracture (ie, hip, clinical spine, wrist, and humerus) compared with incidence of fractures over 10 years of follow-up. Overall ability of FRAX to predict fracture risk based on initial BMD T-score categories (normal, low bone mass, and osteoporosis) was evaluated with receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analyses using area under the curve (AUC). Over 10 years of follow-up, 368 women incurred a hip fracture, and 1011 a major osteoporotic fracture. Women with low bone mass represented the majority (n = 3791, 61\%); they developed many hip (n = 176, 48\%) and major osteoporotic fractures (n = 569, 56\%). Among women with normal and low bone mass, FRAX (including BMD) was an overall better predictor of hip fracture risk (AUC = 0.78 and 0.70, respectively) than major osteoporotic fractures (AUC = 0.64 and 0.62). Simpler models (eg, age + prior fracture) had similar AUCs to FRAX, including among women for whom primary prevention is sought (no prior fracture or osteoporosis by BMD). The FRAX and simpler models predict 10-year risk of incident hip and major osteoporotic fractures in older US women with normal or low bone mass.},

Design Systematic review.
Data sources PubMed until November 2018 and hand searched references from eligible articles.
Eligibility criteria for study selection Studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model in COPD patients and focusing on any potential clinical outcome.
Results The systematic search yielded 228 eligible articles, describing the development of 408 prognostic models, the external validation of 38 models, and the validation of 20 prognostic models derived for diseases other than COPD. The 408 prognostic models were developed in three clinical settings: outpatients (n=239; 59\%), patients admitted to hospital (n=155; 38\%), and patients attending the emergency department (n=14; 3\%). Among the 408 prognostic models, the most prevalent endpoints were mortality (n=209; 51\%), risk for acute exacerbation of COPD (n=42; 10\%), and risk for readmission after the index hospital admission (n=36; 9\%). Overall, the most commonly used predictors were age (n=166; 41\%), forced expiratory volume in one second (n=85; 21\%), sex (n=74; 18\%), body mass index (n=66; 16\%), and smoking (n=65; 16\%). Of the 408 prognostic models, 100 (25\%) were internally validated and 91 (23\%) examined the calibration of the developed model. For 286 (70\%) models a model presentation was not available, and only 56 (14\%) models were presented through the full equation. Model discrimination using the C statistic was available for 311 (76\%) models. 38 models were externally validated, but in only 12 of these was the validation performed by a fully independent team. Only seven prognostic models with an overall low risk of bias according to PROBAST were identified. These models were ADO, B-AE-D, B-AE-D-C, extended ADO, updated ADO, updated BODE, and a model developed by Bertens et al. A meta-analysis of C statistics was performed for 12 prognostic models, and the summary estimates ranged from 0.611 to 0.769.
Conclusions This study constitutes a detailed mapping and assessment of the prognostic models for outcome prediction in COPD patients. The findings indicate several methodological pitfalls in their development and a low rate of external validation. Future research should focus on the improvement of existing models through update and external validation, as well as the assessment of the safety, clinical effectiveness, and cost effectiveness of the application of these prognostic models in clinical practice through impact studies.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbations adversely affect patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Macrolide antibiotics benefit patients with a variety of inflammatory airway diseases.
METHODS: We performed a randomized trial to determine whether azithromycin decreased the frequency of exacerbations in participants with COPD who had an increased risk of exacerbations but no hearing impairment, resting tachycardia, or apparent risk of prolongation of the corrected QT interval.
RESULTS: A total of 1577 subjects were screened; 1142 (72\%) were randomly assigned to receive azithromycin, at a dose of 250 mg daily (570 participants), or placebo (572 participants) for 1 year in addition to their usual care. The rate of 1-year follow-up was 89\% in the azithromycin group and 90\% in the placebo group. The median time to the first exacerbation was 266 days (95\% confidence interval [CI], 227 to 313) among participants receiving azithromycin, as compared with 174 days (95\% CI, 143 to 215) among participants receiving placebo (P{\textless}0.001). The frequency of exacerbations was 1.48 exacerbations per patient-year in the azithromycin group, as compared with 1.83 per patient-year in the placebo group (P=0.01), and the hazard ratio for having an acute exacerbation of COPD per patient-year in the azithromycin group was 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.63 to 0.84; P{\textless}0.001). The scores on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (on a scale of 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating better functioning) improved more in the azithromycin group than in the placebo group (a mean [±SD] decrease of 2.8±12.8 vs. 0.6±11.4, P=0.004); the percentage of participants with more than the minimal clinically important difference of -4 units was 43\% in the azithromycin group, as compared with 36\% in the placebo group (P=0.03). Hearing decrements were more common in the azithromycin group than in the placebo group (25\% vs. 20\%, P=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Among selected subjects with COPD, azithromycin taken daily for 1 year, when added to usual treatment, decreased the frequency of exacerbations and improved quality of life but caused hearing decrements in a small percentage of subjects. Although this intervention could change microbial resistance patterns, the effect of this change is not known.

Design Systematic review.
Data sources Medline and Embase until June 2013.
Eligibility criteria for study selection Studies describing the development or external validation of a multivariable model for predicting CVD risk in the general population.
Results 9965 references were screened, of which 212 articles were included in the review, describing the development of 363 prediction models and 473 external validations. Most models were developed in Europe (n=167, 46\%), predicted risk of fatal or non-fatal coronary heart disease (n=118, 33\%) over a 10 year period (n=209, 58\%). The most common predictors were smoking (n=325, 90\%) and age (n=321, 88\%), and most models were sex specific (n=250, 69\%). Substantial heterogeneity in predictor and outcome definitions was observed between models, and important clinical and methodological information were often missing. The prediction horizon was not specified for 49 models (13\%), and for 92 (25\%) crucial information was missing to enable the model to be used for individual risk prediction. Only 132 developed models (36\%) were externally validated and only 70 (19\%) by independent investigators. Model performance was heterogeneous and measures such as discrimination and calibration were reported for only 65\% and 58\% of the external validations, respectively.
Conclusions There is an excess of models predicting incident CVD in the general population. The usefulness of most of the models remains unclear owing to methodological shortcomings, incomplete presentation, and lack of external validation and model impact studies. Rather than developing yet another similar CVD risk prediction model, in this era of large datasets, future research should focus on externally validating and comparing head-to-head promising CVD risk models that already exist, on tailoring or even combining these models to local settings, and investigating whether these models can be extended by addition of new predictors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The nested case-control study is an efficient epidemiological design whereby a case-control approach is employed within an established cohort. The large number of recent prospective studies and randomized trials conducted in cardiology provide cohorts within which the nested case-control approach is increasingly used.
METHODS: This paper describes the design of the nested case-control study, and evaluates its role in cardiology by reviewing all such studies indexed in Medline from 1966 to 2000. The example of homocysteine is used to illustrate how discrepancies between results of nested case-control and case-control studies played an important role in the decisions and recommendations of national and international organizations.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven nested case-control studies in cardiology were reviewed. The number of studies per year has been increasing since the first publication in 1987. The majority (96\%) of studies evaluated potential risk factors for cardiovascular disease while the remainder evaluated drugs with cardiac adverse effects. In studies of homocysteine and coronary artery disease, nested case-control studies did not confirm the strong association suggested by early case-control studies that may have been influenced by bias (eg, selection, publication, or reverse causality). This led national and international organizations to advise against routine screening.
CONCLUSIONS: The nested case-control study is increasingly used to study causal relationships in cardiology. The large cohorts of cardiac patients created by prospective studies, clinical trials, and administrative databases should be exploited using this methodology to assess potential cardiac risk factors and other causal relationships that cannot be studied in randomized trials.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by the presence of airflow limitation caused by loss of lung elasticity and/or airway narrowing. The pathological hallmark of loss of lung elasticity is emphysema, and airway wall remodelling contributes to the airway narrowing. Using CT, these lesions can be assessed by measuring low attenuation areas (LAA) and airway wall thickness/luminal area, respectively. As previously reported, COPD can be divided into airway dominant, emphysema dominant and mixed phenotypes using CT. In this study, it is postulated that a patient's physique may be associated with the relative contribution of these lesions to airflow obstruction.
METHODS: CT was used to evaluate emphysema and airway dimensions in 201 patients with COPD. Emphysema was evaluated using percentage of LAA voxels (LAA\%) and airway lesion was estimated by percentage wall area (WA\%). Patients were divided into four phenotypes using LAA\% and WA\%.
RESULTS: Body mass index (BMI) was significantly lower in the higher LAA\% phenotype (ie, emphysema dominant and mixed phenotypes). BMI correlated with LAA\% (rho = -0.557, p{\textless}0.0001) but not with WA\%. BMI was significantly lower in the emphysema dominant phenotype than in the airway dominant phenotype, while there was no difference in forced expiratory volume in 1 s \%predicted between the two.
CONCLUSION: A low BMI is associated with the presence of emphysema, but not with airway wall thickening, in male smokers who have COPD. These results support the concept of different COPD phenotypes and suggest that there may be different systemic manifestations of these phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Objectives
To evaluate to what extent emphysema was evident, as identified by High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT), in smokers with normal lung function and to relate age, gender, smoking history, and body mass index (BMI) to the HRCT results. A secondary aim was to study to what extent emphysema was present in smokers with lower normal values of lung function defined as FEV1/FVC ratio percentage of predicted value (89–93\% of predicted value for males and 90–93\% for females) or FEF50 ≤ 60\% of predicted compared with smokers without this definition.

Methods
Fifty-nine smokers, with a mean age of 53 years and with normal lung function, were examined with HRCT.

Results
Emphysema evidenced visually by HRCT was present in 43\% of the subjects. Using a 0–5 grade scale (0=normal finding; 5=emphysema in most slices), the degree of emphysema was almost exclusively 3–4. The type of emphysema was distributed as centrilobular emphysema predominant in 43.5\%, paraseptal emphysema predominant in 43.5\%, and as an equal mixture of these types in 13\%. The presence of emphysema did not differ between the group of smokers with lower normal values of lung function and the rest of the smokers. Smokers with emphysema had significantly lower BMI than those devoid of emphysema, 24 and 27 respectively (p{\textless}0.0011).

Conclusion
There was a high occurrence of visual emphysema in middle-aged smokers with normal lung function. The densitometric quantitative analysis method is inadequate for detecting mild emphysema. High prevalence of emphysema was associated with low BMI.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The number of female smokers developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is rapidly increasing, but whether or not there exists a differential susceptibility by gender remains controversial.
METHODS: How smoking behaviour and subsequent lung function reduction differed by gender was examined in a study including 954 subjects with COPD and 955 subjects without COPD. The study focused on two subgroups: subjects with COPD {\textless}60 years of age (early-onset group, n=316) and subjects with COPD with {\textless}20 pack-years of smoking (low exposure group, n=241).
RESULTS: In the low exposure group, female subjects with COPD had lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) \% predicted (48.7\% vs 55.8\%, p=0.001) and more severe disease (50.4\% vs 35.6\%, p=0.020, in GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) stage 3 and 4) than male subjects with COPD. Females also had lower FEV(1)\% predicted (50.6\% vs 56.0\%, p=0.006) and more severe COPD (41.7\% vs 31.1\% in GOLD stage 3 and 4, p=0.050) in the early-onset group. Using multivariate regression, female gender was associated with 5.7\% lower FEV(1)\% predicted in the low exposure group (p=0.012) and a similar trend was observed in the early-onset group (p=0.057). The number of pack-years was not significantly associated with lung function in female subjects with COPD in this study, and the dose-response relationship between smoking and lung function differed by gender at lower levels of smoking exposure. Interaction analysis suggested that the effect of smoking on lung function might be different by gender (p=0.027 in all subjects with COPD).
CONCLUSIONS: Female gender was associated with lung function reduction and more severe disease in subjects with COPD with early onset of disease or low smoking exposure. The findings may suggest a gender difference in susceptibility to the lung-damaging effects of cigarette smoking, but alternative explanations should be considered.},

It is not known if these differences persist across degrees of COPD severity. Our aim was to identify sex-specific differences in quantitative emphysema within COPD subgroups based on COPD severity.
We included non-Hispanic white and African-American subjects from the COPDGene study with at least 10 pack-years of smoking and COPD Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) spirometry grade II or greater. We examined sex-specific differences in log-transformed emphysema (log per cent low-attenuation area (\%LAA)) by GOLD spirometry grade among subjects with early-onset COPD ({\textless}55 years old) and advanced emphysema ({\textgreater}25\% emphysema).
Compared with females, males had higher log \%LAA: overall (1.97±1.4 versus 1.69±1.6, β=0.32 (0.04), p=1.34×10−14), and among non-Hispanic white (p=8.37×10−14) and African-American subjects (p=0.002). Females with early-onset COPD, severe emphysema and GOLD grade IV COPD had similar emphysema as males, but markedly fewer pack-years smoking (early-onset, p=0.01; severe emphysema and GOLD grade IV, p{\textless}0.001).
This study identifies subsets of female smokers with COPD who are particularly susceptible to parenchymal destruction.

	abstract = {Background
Recent reports indicate that over the next decade rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in women will exceed those in men in the western world, though in most jurisdictions, women continue to smoke less compared with men. Whether female adult smokers are biologically more susceptible to COPD is unknown. This study reviewed the available evidence to determine whether female adult smokers have a faster decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) compared with male adult smokers and whether age modifies the relationship between cigarette smoke and lung function decline.

Methods
A systematic review and a meta-analysis was performed of population-based cohort studies that had a follow-up period of at least 3 years, measured FEV1 on at least two different time points, and presented FEV1 data stratified by gender and smoking status in adults.

Results
Of the 646 potentially relevant articles, 11 studies met these criteria and were included in the analyses (N = 55 709 participants). There was heterogeneity in gender-related results across the studies. However, on average current smokers had a faster annual decline rate in FEV1\% predicted compared with never and former smokers. Female current smokers had with increasing age a significantly faster annual decline in FEV1\% predicted than male current smokers (linear regression analysis, R2 = 0.56; p = 0.008). Age did not materially affect the rate of decline in FEV1\% predicted in male and female former and never smokers (p = 0.775 and p = 0.326, respectively).

Conclusion
As female smokers age, they appear to experience an accelerated decline in FEV1\% predicted compared with male smokers. Future research powered specifically on gender-related changes in lung function is needed to confirm these early findings.},

COPD is easily identified in its early stages by spirometry, yet it is still underdiagnosed, largely because this simple test is not being done in patients at risk for the development of COPD. The most important risk factor by far is cigarette smoking—smoking cessation or even a decrease in smoking can substantially reduce the risk for the development and/or rate of progression of COPD. Increased public awareness, early diagnosis and intervention, and secondary prevention by primary care providers may help reverse the trend of escalating prevalence, mortality, and premature morbidity associated with COPD.},

	abstract = {Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is prevalent in China. The role of body mass index (BMI) in COPD progression and prognosis is unclear. We analyzed the association between BMI and pulmonary function, inflammation levels and exacerbation in Chinese COPD patients.

Methods
Our retrospective real world research included 744 patients with COPD diagnosed by spirometry and hospitalized from January 1st, 2014 to December 31st, 2016. The indicators were gathered from hospital records database and frequency of exacerbation in the three years were followed up. All 744 patients were divided into four groups by BMI grades. We analyzed the association between BMI and pulmonary function, inflammation levels and exacerbation by Spearman bivariate correlations, Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression.

Results
The singly proportion (median of BMI) of these patients in underweight, normal weight, overweight and obesity was 7.80\% (17.54), 45.97\% (22.12), 27.96\% (27.00) and 18.28\% (31.25) respectively. With increasing of BMI grades, the values of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory flow (FEF25/50/75) and diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) were correspondingly increasing; the percentage of neutrophils and C-reactive protein (CRP) presented significant declining trend while the trend of the percentage of eosinophils was negative; the dose of systemic corticosteroid and length of stay present decreasing tendency; the frequency of exacerbation and hospitalization were decreasing. These were similar results in gender, smoking status COPD subgroups.

Conclusions
In our study, BMI was moderately correlated with pulmonary function positively and exacerbations negatively. To some extent, BMI might be a useful indicator to predict the prognosis of COPD patients and for long-term management.},

AIM: To verify the hypothesis that fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) are associated with the extent of emphysema in COPD patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 112 stable, male current or ex-smokers with or without COPD attending a secondary care specialist COPD clinic were studied. FFM and FM were measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. We also assessed the nutrition status, muscle strength by the handgrip test, exercise tolerance by the 6-minute walking test, airflow limitation and diffusion capacity, the extent of emphysema by high-resolution CT scan, systemic inflammation status using C-reactive protein, and a lipid-related hormone (adiponectin).
RESULTS: The FFM index (FFMI), which was defined as the FFM divided by the square of the body height, was significantly correlated with age, the total number of lymphocytes, handgrip strength, distance on 6-minute walking, airflow limitation, diffusion capacity, extent of emphysema, and C-reactive protein. On multivariate analysis, the FFMI was associated with handgrip strength and inversely correlated with the extent of emphysema. The FM index (FMI) was positively correlated with pack-years, and was inversely correlated with the extent of emphysema and concentrations of adiponectin.
CONCLUSION: The extent of emphysema was correlated with skeletal muscle loss and also the FM.},

Expressed in ml/y, the mean annual postBD FEV1 decline was 27 mL (0.22\%P, 1.32\%B) in patients with baseline COPD and 36 (0.14\%P, 1.36\%B) in those without. Faster decline (in mL/y) was associated with higher baseline lung function, with significant response to bronchodilators, older age and smoking at baseline, also in women with chronic cough and phlegm, or ≥2 respiratory exacerbations in the previous year, and in men with asthma.

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is thought to result in rapid and progressive loss of lung function usually expressed as mean values for whole cohorts.
OBJECTIVES: Longitudinal studies evaluating individual lung function loss and other domains of COPD progression are needed.
METHODS: We evaluated 1,198 stable, well-characterized patients with COPD (1,100 males) recruited in two centers (Florida and Tenerife, Spain) and annually monitored their multidomain progression from 1997 to 2009. Patients were followed for a median of 64 months and up to 10 years. Their individual FEV(1) (L) and BODE index slopes, expressed as annual change, were evaluated using regression models for repeated measures. A total of 751 patients with at least three measurements were used for the analyses.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eighteen percent of patients had a statistically significant FEV(1) slope decline (-86 ml/yr; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -32 to -278 ml/yr). Higher baseline FEV(1) (relative risk, 1.857; 95\% CI, 1.322-2.610; P {\textless} 0.001) and low body mass index (relative risk, 1.071; 95\% CI, 1.035-1.106; P {\textless} 0.001) were independently associated with FEV(1) decline. The BODE index had a statistically significant increase (0.55, 0.20-1.37 point/yr) in only 14\% of patients and these had more severe baseline obstruction. Concordance between FEV1 and BODE change was low (κ Cohen, 16\%). Interestingly, 73\% of patients had no significant slope change in FEV1 or BODE. Only the BODE change was associated with mortality in patients without FEV(1) progression.
CONCLUSIONS: The progression of COPD is very heterogeneous. Most patients show no statistically significant decline of FEV(1) or increase in BODE. The multidimensional evaluation of COPD should offer insight into response to COPD management.},

	abstract = {It is clear that being underweight is a poor prognostic sign in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is also clear that undernutrition is at least in part associated with the severity of airflow obstruction. While both weight and body mass index are useful screening tools in the initial nutritional evaluation, fat-free mass (FFM) may be a better marker of undernutrition in patients with COPD. The causes of cachexia in patients with COPD are multifactorial and include decreased oral intake, the effect of increased work of breathing due to abnormal respiratory mechanics, and the effect of chronic systemic inflammation. Active nutritional supplementation in undernourished patients with COPD can lead to weight gain and improvements in respiratory muscle function and exercise performance. However, long-term effects of nutritional supplementation are not clear. In addition, the optimal type of nutritional supplementation needs to be explored further. The role of novel forms of treatment, such as androgens or appetite stimulants designed to increase FFM, also needs to be further studied. Thus, in the absence of definitive data, it cannot be said that long-term weight gain, either using enhanced caloric intake, with or without anabolic steroids or appetite stimulants, offers survival or other benefits to patients with COPD. However, there are indications from single-center trials that this is an avenue well worth exploring.},

	abstract = {Objectives
To evaluate to what extent emphysema was evident, as identified by High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT), in smokers with normal lung function and to relate age, gender, smoking history, and body mass index (BMI) to the HRCT results. A secondary aim was to study to what extent emphysema was present in smokers with lower normal values of lung function defined as FEV1/FVC ratio percentage of predicted value (89–93\% of predicted value for males and 90–93\% for females) or FEF50 ≤ 60\% of predicted compared with smokers without this definition.

Methods
Fifty-nine smokers, with a mean age of 53 years and with normal lung function, were examined with HRCT.

Results
Emphysema evidenced visually by HRCT was present in 43\% of the subjects. Using a 0–5 grade scale (0=normal finding; 5=emphysema in most slices), the degree of emphysema was almost exclusively 3–4. The type of emphysema was distributed as centrilobular emphysema predominant in 43.5\%, paraseptal emphysema predominant in 43.5\%, and as an equal mixture of these types in 13\%. The presence of emphysema did not differ between the group of smokers with lower normal values of lung function and the rest of the smokers. Smokers with emphysema had significantly lower BMI than those devoid of emphysema, 24 and 27 respectively (p{\textless}0.0011).

Conclusion
There was a high occurrence of visual emphysema in middle-aged smokers with normal lung function. The densitometric quantitative analysis method is inadequate for detecting mild emphysema. High prevalence of emphysema was associated with low BMI.},

The aim of this article is to provide a series of consensus-based best practices regarding the process of model conceptualization. For the purpose of this series of papers, the authors consider the development of models whose purpose is to inform medical decisions and health-related resource allocation questions. They specifically divide the conceptualization process into two distinct components: the conceptualization of the problem, which converts knowledge of the health care process or decision into a representation of the problem, followed by the conceptualization of the model itself, which matches the attributes and characteristics of a particular modeling type to the needs of the problem being represented. Recommendations are made regarding the structure of the modeling team, agreement on the statement of the problem, the structure, perspective and target population of the model, and the interventions and outcomes represented. Best practices relating to the specific characteristics of model structure, and which characteristics of the problem might be most easily represented in a specific modeling method, are presented. Each section contains a number of recommendations that were iterated among the authors, as well as the wider modeling taskforce, jointly set up by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research and the Society for Medical Decision Making.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The outcome of childhood asthma in adults has been described in high-risk cohorts, but few population-based studies have reported the risk factors for persistence and relapse.
METHODS: We assessed children born from April 1972 through March 1973 in Dunedin, New Zealand, repeatedly from 9 to 26 years of age with questionnaires, pulmonary-function tests, bronchial-challenge testing, and allergy testing.
RESULTS: By the age of 26 years, 51.4 percent of 613 study members with complete respiratory data had reported wheezing at more than one assessment. Eighty-nine study members (14.5 percent) had wheezing that persisted from childhood to 26 years of age, whereas 168 (27.4 percent) had remission, but 76 (12.4 percent) subsequently relapsed by the age of 26. Sensitization to house dust mites predicted the persistence of wheezing (odds ratio, 2.41; P=0.001) and relapse (odds ratio, 2.18; P=0.01), as did airway hyperresponsiveness (odds ratio for persistence, 3.00; P{\textless}0.001; odds ratio for relapse, 3.03; P{\textless}0.001). Female sex predicted the persistence of wheezing (odds ratio, 1.71; P=0.03), as did smoking at the age of 21 years (odds ratio, 1.84; P=0.01). The earlier the age at onset, the greater the risk of relapse (odds ratio, 0.89 per year of increase in the age at onset; P{\textless}0.001). Pulmonary function was consistently lower in those with persistent wheezing than in those without persistent wheezing.
CONCLUSIONS: In an unselected birth cohort, more than one in four children had wheezing that persisted from childhood to adulthood or that relapsed after remission. The factors predicting persistence or relapse were sensitization to house dust mites, airway hyperresponsiveness, female sex, smoking, and early age at onset. These findings, together with persistently low lung function, suggest that outcomes in adult asthma may be determined primarily in early childhood.},

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of primary prevention programmes for Dutch children in a decision-analytic framework.
METHODS: A decision-analytic tree model analysing healthcare costs and asthma cases prevented was developed to compare usual care (UC) with two UF and three MF programmes on the primary prevention of asthma amongst children. Programmes were evaluated through incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefits. Decision and parameter uncertainty were subjected to value-of-information analyses.
RESULTS: The current UC and one of three MF programmes dominated the other alternatives. The MF programme was more costly but also more effective than UC at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of {\textless}euro{\textgreater}8,209.20/additional asthma case prevented. The value of perfect information to reduce uncertainty was {\textless}euro{\textgreater}291.6M at its lowest. Most of the uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness threshold was attributable to the probability and cost estimates for low-risk children.
CONCLUSION: This study supports the feasibility of a structured programme that simultaneously addresses exposure to house dust mites, pet dander, environmental tobacco, and breast-feeding as a cost-effective alternative to UC in the primary prevention of asthma amongst children.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lifetime lung function is related to quality of life and longevity. Over the lifespan, individuals follow different lung function trajectories. Identification of these trajectories, their determinants, and outcomes is important, but no study has done this beyond the fourth decade.
METHODS: We used six waves of the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS) to model lung function trajectories measured at 7, 13, 18, 45, 50, and 53 years. We analysed pre-bronchodilator FEV1 z-scores at the six timepoints using group-based trajectory modelling to identify distinct subgroups of individuals whose measurements followed a similar pattern over time. We related the trajectories identified to childhood factors and risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using logistic regression, and estimated population-attributable fractions of COPD.
FINDINGS: Of the 8583 participants in the original cohort, 2438 had at least two waves of lung function data at age 7 years and 53 years and comprised the study population. We identified six trajectories: early below average, accelerated decline (97 [4\%] participants); persistently low (136 [6\%] participants); early low, accelerated growth, normal decline (196 [8\%] participants); persistently high (293 [12\%] participants); below average (772 [32\%] participants); and average (944 [39\%] participants). The three trajectories early below average, accelerated decline; persistently low; and below average had increased risk of COPD at age 53 years compared with the average group (early below average, accelerated decline: odds ratio 35·0, 95\% CI 19·5-64·0; persistently low: 9·5, 4·5-20·6; and below average: 3·7, 1·9-6·9). Early-life predictors of the three trajectories included childhood asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, allergic rhinitis, eczema, parental asthma, and maternal smoking. Personal smoking and active adult asthma increased the impact of maternal smoking and childhood asthma, respectively, on the early below average, accelerated decline trajectory.
INTERPRETATION: We identified six potential FEV1 trajectories, two of which were novel. Three trajectories contributed 75\% of COPD burden and were associated with modifiable early-life exposures whose impact was aggravated by adult factors. We postulate that reducing maternal smoking, encouraging immunisation, and avoiding personal smoking, especially in those with smoking parents or low childhood lung function, might minimise COPD risk. Clinicians and patients with asthma should be made aware of the potential long-term implications of non-optimal asthma control for lung function trajectory throughout life, and the role and benefit of optimal asthma control on improving lung function should be investigated in future intervention trials.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 1964, The Melbourne Asthma Study was established to describe the spectrum and natural history of childhood asthma.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and lung function outcome of childhood asthma to the age of 50 years.
METHOD: Subjects were invited to complete an interviewer-administered questionnaire, skin prick testing, and measurement of lung function from the age of 7 years to the age of 50 years at 7-year intervals.
RESULTS: Of 458 survivors (from the original 484 subjects at recruitment), 346 subjects (76\%) participated, of whom, 197 completed lung function measurement. Asthma remission at the age of 50 years was 64\% in those with wheezy bronchitis, 47\% for those with persistent asthma, and 15\% for those with severe asthma in childhood. Multivariable analysis identified severe asthma in childhood (odds ratio [OR] 11.9 [95\% CI, 3.4-41.8]), female sex (OR 2.0 [95\% CI, 1.1-3.6]), and childhood hay fever (OR 2.0 [95\% CI, 1.0-4.0]) as risk factors for "current asthma" at age 50 years. There was no evidence of a difference in the rate of decline in FEV1 (mL/y, 95\% CI) between the severe asthma group (15 mL/y [95\% CI, 9-22 mL/y]) and all the other recruitment groups: control (16 mL/y [95\% CI, 12-20 mL/y]), mild wheezy bronchitis (14 mL/y [95\% CI, 8-19 mL/y]), wheezy bronchitis (16 mL/y [95\% CI, 11-20 mL/y]), and persistent asthma (19 mL/y [95\% CI, 13-24 mL/y]).
CONCLUSION: The clinical and lung function outcome in adult life is strongly determined by asthma severity in childhood. The reduced lung function seen in adults is established in childhood and does not appear to decline more rapidly in adult years despite continuing symptoms.},

Methods We studied patients with bipolar I disorder who newly initiated an oral AA between 2002 and 2008. Utilization measures included adherence [medication possession ratio (MPR) ≥80\%], persistence (gaps ≤15 days between refills and an absence of ≥30 days of continuous concomitant non-index AA use), non-compliance (16–29 day gaps with no evidence of switch/augmentation), and discontinuation of the index AA (≥30 days without index AA, no evidence of switch/augmentation). Results The study included 16 807 patients: mean age 43.3 years, 67.7\% female. Overall, adherence to the index AA was low (8.3\%; mean MPR = 0.2). Only 10.5\% of the patients were persistent to index AA, another 13.6\% were non-compliant, and 63.4\% discontinued index AA with an average time to discontinuation of 66 days. A majority (69.5\%) of the discontinued patients did not resume any antipsychotic therapy. Results were similar across insurance types and index AA. Conclusion Adherence to and persistence with AA treatment were low in new users with bipolar I disorder. Most patients discontinued the index AA and did not restart any antipsychotic treatment.

	abstract = {Recent clinical trials demonstrating that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) does not prevent coronary heart disease in women have again raised doubts concerning observational studies. Although much of the explanation probably lies in what might be called the "healthy HRT user" effect, another contributing factor may be that most observational studies included many prevalent users: women taking HRT for some time before study follow-up began. This practice can cause two types of bias, both of which plausibly may have contributed to the discrepancy between observational and randomized studies. First, prevalent users are "survivors" of the early period of pharmacotherapy, which can introduce substantial bias if risk varies with time, just as in studies of operative procedures that enroll patients after they have survived surgery. This article provides several examples of medications for which the hazard function varies with time and thus would be subject to prevalent user bias. Second, covariates for drug users at study entry often are plausibly affected by the drug itself. Investigators often do not adjust for these factors on the causal pathway, which may introduce confounding. A new-user design eliminates these biases by restricting the analysis to persons under observation at the start of the current course of treatment. This article thus argues that such designs should be used more frequently in pharmacoepidemiology.},

	shorttitle = {On the variability of regression shrinkage methods for clinical prediction models},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11493},
	abstract = {When developing risk prediction models, shrinkage methods are recommended, especially when the sample size is limited. Several earlier studies have shown that the shrinkage of model coefficients can reduce overfitting of the prediction model and subsequently result in better predictive performance on average. In this simulation study, we aimed to investigate the variability of regression shrinkage on predictive performance for a binary outcome, with focus on the calibration slope. The slope indicates whether risk predictions are too extreme (slope {\textless} 1) or not extreme enough (slope {\textgreater} 1). We investigated the following shrinkage methods in comparison to standard maximum likelihood estimation: uniform shrinkage (likelihood-based and bootstrap-based), ridge regression, penalized maximum likelihood, LASSO regression, adaptive LASSO, non-negative garrote, and Firth's correction. There were three main findings. First, shrinkage improved calibration slopes on average. Second, the between-sample variability of calibration slopes was often increased relative to maximum likelihood. Among the shrinkage methods, the bootstrap-based uniform shrinkage worked well overall. In contrast to other shrinkage approaches, Firth's correction had only a small shrinkage effect but did so with low variability.

	abstract = {When developing risk prediction models, shrinkage methods are recommended, especially when the sample size is limited. Several earlier studies have shown that the shrinkage of model coefficients can reduce overfitting of the prediction model and subsequently result in better predictive performance on average. In this simulation study, we aimed to investigate the variability of regression shrinkage on predictive performance for a binary outcome, with focus on the calibration slope. The slope indicates whether risk predictions are too extreme (slope {\textless} 1) or not extreme enough (slope {\textgreater} 1). We investigated the following shrinkage methods in comparison to standard maximum likelihood estimation: uniform shrinkage (likelihood-based and bootstrap-based), ridge regression, penalized maximum likelihood, LASSO regression, adaptive LASSO, non-negative garrote, and Firth's correction. There were three main findings. First, shrinkage improved calibration slopes on average. Second, the between-sample variability of calibration slopes was often increased relative to maximum likelihood. Among the shrinkage methods, the bootstrap-based uniform shrinkage worked well overall. In contrast to other shrinkage approaches, Firth's correction had only a small shrinkage effect but did so with low variability. Third, the correlation between the estimated shrinkage and the optimal shrinkage to remove overfitting was typically negative. Hence, although shrinkage improved predictions on average, it often worked poorly in individual datasets, in particular when shrinkage was most needed. The observed variability of shrinkage methods implies that these methods do not solve problems associated with small sample size or low number of events per variable.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The nested case-control study is an efficient epidemiological design whereby a case-control approach is employed within an established cohort. The large number of recent prospective studies and randomized trials conducted in cardiology provide cohorts within which the nested case-control approach is increasingly used.
METHODS: This paper describes the design of the nested case-control study, and evaluates its role in cardiology by reviewing all such studies indexed in Medline from 1966 to 2000. The example of homocysteine is used to illustrate how discrepancies between results of nested case-control and case-control studies played an important role in the decisions and recommendations of national and international organizations.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven nested case-control studies in cardiology were reviewed. The number of studies per year has been increasing since the first publication in 1987. The majority (96\%) of studies evaluated potential risk factors for cardiovascular disease while the remainder evaluated drugs with cardiac adverse effects. In studies of homocysteine and coronary artery disease, nested case-control studies did not confirm the strong association suggested by early case-control studies that may have been influenced by bias (eg, selection, publication, or reverse causality). This led national and international organizations to advise against routine screening.
CONCLUSIONS: The nested case-control study is increasingly used to study causal relationships in cardiology. The large cohorts of cardiac patients created by prospective studies, clinical trials, and administrative databases should be exploited using this methodology to assess potential cardiac risk factors and other causal relationships that cannot be studied in randomized trials.},

Furthermore, inflammatory cytokine levels in the blood are associated with disease severity and rate of progression. However, the factors driving this immune response in PD are not well established. We investigated cell-extrinsic factors in systemic immune activation by using α-synuclein monomers and fibrils, as well as bacterial toxins, to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from 31 patients and age/gender-matched controls. α-synuclein monomers or fibrils resulted in a robust cytokine response (as measured by supernatant cytokine concentrations and mRNA expression in cultured cells) in both PD and control PBMCs, similar to that induced by bacterial LPS. We found no PD vs. control differences in cytokine production, nor in mRNA expression. Levels of endotoxin within the recombinant α-synuclein used in these experiments were very low (0.2–1.3EU/mL), but nonetheless we found that comparable levels were sufficient to potentially confound our cytokine concentration measurements for a number of cytokines. However, α-synuclein monomers increased production of IL-1β and IL-18 to levels significantly in excess of those induced by low-level endotoxin. In conclusion, this study: (i) highlights the importance of accounting for low-level endotoxin in antigen-PBMC stimulation experiments; (ii) indicates that cell-extrinsic factors may be a major contributor to immune activation in PD; and (iii) suggests that α-synuclein may play a role in inflammasome-related cytokine production in the periphery.},

	abstract = {Objectives
We aimed to compare the performance of different regression modeling approaches for the prediction of heterogeneous treatment effects.
Study Design and Setting
We simulated trial samples (n = 3,600; 80\% power for a treatment odds ratio of 0.8) from a superpopulation (N = 1,000,000) with 12 binary risk predictors, both without and with six true treatment interactions. We assessed predictions of treatment benefit for four regression models: a “risk model” (with a constant effect of treatment assignment) and three “effect models” (including interactions of risk predictors with treatment assignment). Three novel performance measures were evaluated: calibration for benefit (i.e., observed vs. predicted risk difference in treated vs. untreated), discrimination for benefit, and prediction error for benefit.
Results
The risk modeling approach was well-calibrated for benefit, whereas effect models were consistently overfit, even with doubled sample sizes. Penalized regression reduced miscalibration of the effect models considerably. In terms of discrimination and prediction error, the risk modeling approach was superior in the absence of true treatment effect interactions, whereas penalized regression was optimal in the presence of true treatment interactions.
Conclusion
A risk modeling approach yields models consistently well calibrated for benefit. Effect modeling may improve discrimination for benefit in the presence of true interactions but is prone to overfitting. Hence, effect models—including only plausible interactions—should be fitted using penalized regression.},

One method to create probabilities is to directly train a kernel classifier with a logit link function and a regularized maximum likelihood score. However, training with a maximum likelihood score will produce non-sparse kernel machines. Instead, we train an SVM, then train the parameters of an additional sigmoid function to map the SVM outputs into probabilities. This chapter compares classification error rate and likelihood scores for an SVM plus sigmoid versus a kernel method trained with a regularized likelihood error function. These methods are tested on three data-mining-style data sets. The SVM+sigmoid yields probabilities of comparable quality to the regularized maximum likelihood kernel method, while still retaining the sparseness of the SVM.},

In stepwise Cox regression analyses of 100 bootstrap samples using 17 candidate variables, the most frequently selected variables were those selected in the original analysis, and no other important variable was identified. Thus there was no reason to doubt the model obtained in the original analysis. For each patient in the trial, bootstrap confidence intervals were constructed for the estimated probability of surviving two years. It is shown graphically that these intervals are markedly wider than those obtained from the original model.},

	abstract = {Alpha-synuclein is an abundant neuronal protein that has been linked to both normal synaptic function and neurodegeneration--in particular, Parkinson's disease (PD). Uncovering mechanisms that control alpha-synuclein transcription is therefore critical for PD pathogenesis and synaptic function. We previously reported that in PC12 cells and primary neurons, alpha-synuclein is transcriptionally up-regulated after application of growth factors. In the current work we have characterized the pathway involved in this regulation in PC12 cells. The MAP/ERK pathway, and in particular Ras, is both sufficient and necessary for the NGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) -mediated response. Significantly, response elements for this pathway, including a putative occult promoter, lie within intron 1, a hitherto unappreciated regulatory region of the gene that may be utilized in this or other settings. The PI3 kinase pathway is also involved in alpha-synuclein regulation, but response elements for this pathway appear to lie primarily outside of intron 1. These findings indicate that NGF- and bFGF-mediated signal transduction via the MAP/ERK and PI3 kinase pathways, and in part via regulatory regions within intron 1, may be involved in alpha-synuclein transcriptional regulation. Targeting of these pathways may serve to modulate alpha-synuclein so that it achieves desirable levels within neuronal cells.},

The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) assessment test (CAT) is a short questionnaire that has facilitated health status measurements in subjects with COPD. However, it remains controversial as to whether the CAT can be used as a suitable substitute for the St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). This study investigated the reliability and score distributions of the CAT and SGRQ and evaluated which factors contributed to health status for each questionnaire.

Methods
A total of 109 consecutive subjects with stable COPD from a single center were enrolled in this study. Each subject completed pulmonary function tests, exercise tests, and the following self-administered questionnaires: the Baseline Dyspnea Index, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the CAT, and SGRQ.

Results
Internal consistencies of CAT and SGRQ total scores were both excellent (Cronbach’s α coefficients =0.890 and 0.933). Statistically significant correlations were observed between CAT and SGRQ total scores (R=0.668, P{\textless}0.001). Correlations of CAT scores with parameters related to pulmonary function, dyspnea, exercise performance, and psychological factors were inferior to correlations with those parameters with SGRQ total scores. Both multiple regression analyses and principal component analyses revealed that there were slight differences between SGRQ total scores and CAT scores.

Conclusion
The CAT is similar to SGRQ in terms of discriminating health status. However, we demonstrated that what is assessed by the CAT may differ slightly from what is measured by SGRQ.},

As these infections contribute considerably to the clinical course of the patient with COPD, they constitute a significant comorbidity in COPD. Recurrent acute infections by bacterial and/or viral pathogens are now clearly linked with the occurrence of exacerbations of COPD. In addition, the occurrence of pneumonia in COPD has received considerable recent attention as it appears to be increased by the use of inhaled corticosteroids. The role of chronic infection in the pathogenesis of COPD is an active area of research with several different types of pathogens potentially implicated. Additionally, COPD patients with HIV infection have a more rapidly progressive decline in lung function than non-HIV-infected patients.

Alveolar hypoxia and consequent hypoxemia increase in prevalence as disease severity increases.

Uncorrected chronic hypoxemia is associated with the development of adverse sequelae of COPD, including pulmonary hypertension, secondary polycythemia, systemic inflammation, and skeletal muscle dysfunction. A combination of these factors leads to diminished quality of life, reduced exercise tolerance, increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity, and greater risk of death. Concomitant sleep-disordered breathing may place a small but significant subset of COPD patients at increased risk of these complications. Long-term oxygen therapy has been shown to improve pulmonary hemodynamics, reduce erythrocytosis, and improve survival in selected patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. However, the optimal treatment for patients with exertional oxyhemoglobin desaturation, isolated nocturnal hypoxemia, or mild-to-moderate resting daytime hypoxemia remains uncertain.},

Optimal treatment of OSAS with continuous positive airway pressure may reverse the cognitive and affective dysfunction, however, in some patients a residual impairment persists. This persistent deficit, despite effective treatment, raises the possibility of a remaining subtle structural brain damage; such damage has been demonstrated through the use of sensitive functional and other neuroimaging techniques.

Sixty-four percent of patients with COPD showed abnormalities in MMSE, predominantly in recent memory, construction, attention, language, and orientation domains. Functional abnormalities were correlated with cognitive abnormalities. Although COPD patients did not show significant depression compared to controls, 77.7\%. of the patients showed subjective and objective cognitive disturbance and 72.2\% of the patients were classified as questionable or mild dementia. In conclusion, patients with COPD show significant cognitive and functional impairments that cannot be explained just by coincidence or by depression.},

The primary daytime sequelae of the disorder include patient reports of excessive daytime sleepiness, depression, and attention and concentration problems. It has been well established that OSAHS negatively impacts certain aspects of cognitive functioning. The primary goals of this article are to (1) clarify the pattern of cognitive deficits that are specific to OSAHS; (2) identify the specific cognitive domains that improve with treatment; and (3) elucidate the possible mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in OSAHS. At the conclusion of the paper, we propose a potential neurofunctional theory to account for the etiology of cognitive deficits in OSAHS. Thirty-seven peer-reviewed articles were selected for this review. In general, findings were equivocal for most cognitive domains. Treatment, however, was noted to improve attention/vigilance in most studies and consistently did not improve constructional abilities or psychomotor functioning. The results are discussed in the context of a neurofunctional theory for the effects of OSAHS on the brain.},

The factors-nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Helicobacter pylori, and cigarette smoking-have been identified as major risk factors for peptic ulcer in numerous clinical and epidemiologic studies. Overall risk ratios for each risk factor were based on meta-analyses of English-language studies of risk for peptic ulcer-related GI events. Exposure estimates for factors used data from North American populations. Summary risk and exposure values were computed for the general population, males and females separately, and the elderly. Hypothetical models of multiple factor attributable risks were developed using population attributable risk percent calculated from these summary values. General population attributable risk percent were as follows: 24\%, NSAIDs; 48\%, H. pylori; and 23\%, cigarette smoking. Based on these numbers, the "no interaction" attributable risk model estimates that 95\% of total peptic ulcer related risk is attributable to these factors in the general population. The "interaction" model attributes 89\% of cases to these risk factors: 24\%, NSAIDs alone; 31\%, H. pylori alone; 34\%, H. pylori/smoking combined. Between 89\% and 95\% of peptic ulcer-related serious upper GI events may be attributed to NSAID use, H. pylori infection, and cigarette smoking.},

Increased circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins occur in stable disease, and COPD exacerbations are notably associated with pulmonary and systemic inflammation. Although the course of inflammation is determined by the balance between pro- and antiinflammatory mediators, in COPD most attention has focused on the former. During exacerbation, however, upregulation of antiinflammatory markers occurs. The main causes of systemic inflammation in COPD remain to be elucidated, although systemic hypoxia is a candidate factor. Although a relationship between lung and systemic inflammation has been suggested, experimental evidence indicates no direct correlations in the regulation of inflammation in the pulmonary and systemic compartments. Longitudinal studies are needed to unravel the role of systemic inflammation in the course of COPD, to analyze the role of acute exacerbations on the chronicity of inflammation, and to evaluate the response of systemic inflammation to different interventions. Emphasis should be placed on the identification of signaling pathways induced and/or altered in skeletal muscle by inflammation, as muscle wasting is a prominent feature of chronic inflammatory disease conditions and contributes significantly to impaired physical functioning and health status in COPD.},

For many years bacterial infection has not been thought to have an important effect in the pathology of this condition. Recent advances in diagnostic techniques, particularly the use 16S sequencing has demonstrated that there are a large range of bacteria present in the lower respiratory tract, both in terms of exacerbations and chronic colonization. A proportion of the bacteria present in the lower respiratory have also been shown to produce inflammation and hence are likely to be relevant for the pathogenesis of COPD. The accurate diagnosis of bacterial infection in individual patients remains a major challenge. The trials that have assessed the effect of antibiotics in COPD have generally been of low quality and have not been placebo controlled. Recent studies of macrolides for long-term treatment in COPD have found significantly reduced rates of exacerbations. Major challenges remain in accurately defining the potential role of bacteria in the inflammatory process and how best to optimize the use of antibiotics without the overuse of this limited resource. Alternative strategies to treat infection in COPD remain very limited.},

Respiratory viral infections, especially rhinoviruses, are a major cause of COPD exacerbations, with upper respiratory tract infections being associated with over 50\% of COPD exacerbations. The presence of an upper respiratory tract infection leads to a more severe exacerbation and a longer symptom recovery time at exacerbation. Respiratory viral infections occurring during COPD exacerbations are more likely to lead to hospitalization. Sputum inflammatory markers were found to be higher in those patients with symptoms of a common cold or where rhinovirus was detected at exacerbation, thus suggesting that viral infections lead to greater airway inflammation and thus more severe exacerbations. COPD exacerbations are associated also with systemic inflammatory effects with increases in markers such as plasma fibrinogen and interleukin-6. Respiratory viruses have also been detected when the patients are stable, and this suggests that chronic viral infection may occur. Strategies to prevent viral infection will have a significant effect on the morbidity of COPD and will improve quality of life.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis and consequences of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has increased substantially in the last decade. Several new lines of evidence demonstrate that bacterial isolation from sputum during acute exacerbation in many instances reflects a cause-effect relationship. Placebo-controlled antibiotic trials in exacerbations of COPD demonstrate significant clinical benefits of antibiotic treatment in moderate and severe episodes. However, in the multitude of antibiotic comparison trials, the choice of antibiotics does not appear to affect the clinical outcome, which can be explained by several methodological limitations of these trials. Recently, comparison trials with nontraditional end-points have shown differences among antibiotics in the treatment of exacerbations of COPD. Observational studies that have examined clinical outcome of exacerbations have repeatedly demonstrated certain clinical characteristics to be associated with treatment failure or early relapse. Optimal antibiotic selection for exacerbations has therefore incorporated quantifying the risk for a poor outcome of the exacerbation and choosing antibiotics differently for low risk and high risk patients, reserving the broader spectrum drugs for the high risk patients. Though improved outcomes in exacerbations with antibiotic choice based on such risk stratification has not yet been demonstrated in prospective controlled trials, this approach takes into account concerns of disease heterogeneity, antibiotic resistance and judicious antibiotic use in exacerbations.},

Verbal memory and learning constitute the second most commonly impaired cognitive domain in patients with COPD. The prevalence of impairment in visuospatial memory and intermediate visual memory is 26.9\% and 19.2\%, respectively. We found that cognitive impairment is associated with the profile of COPD severity and its comorbidities.

	abstract = {Background Comorbidities associated with systemic inflammation including cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke and diabetes mellitus (DM) are common among individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A study was undertaken to quantify the burden of comorbidity and to determine the risk of first acute arteriovascular events among individuals with COPD.
Methods The computerised primary care records of 1 204 100 members of the general population aged ≥35 years on 25 February 2005 were searched for recordings of each disease. Data were analysed using multivariate logistic regression. Cox regression was used to determine whether individuals with COPD were at increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke.
Results Cross-sectional analyses showed that physician-diagnosed COPD was associated with increased risks of CVD (OR 4.98, 95\% CI 4.85 to 5.81; p{\textless}0.001), stroke (OR 3.34, 95\% CI 3.21 to 3.48; p{\textless}0.001) and DM (OR 2.04, 95\% CI 1.97 to 2.12; p{\textless}0.001). In the follow-up analyses, after adjusting for confounding by sex and smoking status and stratifying for age, the greatest increase in the rate of acute arteriovascular events was found in the youngest age groups; the HR for acute MI was 10.34 (95\% CI 3.28 to 32.60; p{\textless}0.001) and for stroke the HR was 3.44 (95\% CI 0.85 to 13.84; p{\textless}0.001) compared with the oldest age group.
Conclusion Individuals with COPD are substantially more likely to have pre-existing CVD, DM or a previous stroke and are at high risk of acute arteriovascular events. National COPD guidelines and models of care need to adapt to provide an integrated approach to addressing these comorbidities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Information about health care utilization and costs among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is needed to improve care and for appropriate allocation of resources for patients with COPD (COPD patients or cases) in managed care organizations.
METHODS: Analysis of all inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy utilization of 1522 COPD patients continuously enrolled during 1997 in a 172,484-member health maintenance organization. Each COPD case was matched with 3 controls (n = 4566) by age (+/-5 years) and sex. Information on tobacco use and comorbidities was obtained by chart review of 200 patients from each group.
RESULTS: Patients with COPD were 2.3 times more likely to be admitted to the hospital at least once during the year, and those admitted had longer average lengths of stay (4.7 vs 3.9 days; P{\textless}.001). Mean costs per case and control were \$5093 vs \$2026 for inpatient services, \$5042 vs \$3050 for outpatient services, and \$1545 vs \$739 for outpatient pharmacy services, respectively (P{\textless}.001 for all differences). Patients with COPD had a longer smoking history (49.5 vs 34.9 pack-years; P =.002) and a higher prevalence of smoking-related comorbid conditions and were more likely to use cigarettes during the study period (46.0\% vs 13.5\%; P{\textless}.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Health care utilization among COPD patients is approximately twice that of age- and sex-matched controls, with much of the difference attributable to smoking-related diseases. In this health maintenance organization, inpatient costs were similar to and outpatient costs were much higher than national averages for COPD patients covered by Medicare.},

	abstract = {Skewed data is the main issue in statistical models in healthcare costs. Data transformation is a conventional method to decrease skewness, but there are some disadvantages. Some recent studies have employed generalized linear models (GLMs) and Cox proportional hazard regression as alternative estimators., The aim of this study was to investigate how well these alternative estimators perform in terms of bias and precision when the data are skewed. The primary outcome was an estimation of population means of healthcare costs and the secondary outcome was the impact of a covariate on healthcare cost. Alternative estimators, such as ordinary least squares (OLS) for Ln(y) or Log(y), Gamma, Weibull and Cox proportional hazard regression models, were compared using Monte Carlo simulation under different situations, which were generated from skewed distributions., We found that there was not one best model across all generated conditions. However, GLMs, especially the Gamma regression model, behaved well in the estimation of population means of healthcare costs. The results showed that the Cox proportional hazard model exhibited a poor estimation of population means of healthcare costs and the β1 even under proportional hazard data. Approximately results are consistent by increasing the sample size. However, increasing the sample size could improve the performance of the OLS-based model.},

COPD remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this study were to estimate (1) national US COPD-attributable annual medical costs by payer (direct) and absenteeism (indirect) in 2010 and projected medical costs through 2020 and (2) state-specific COPD-attributable medical and absenteeism costs in 2010.METHODS:
We used the 2006-2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey, and 2010 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data to generate cost estimates and 2010 census data to project medical costs through 2020.RESULTS:
In 2010, total national medical costs attributable to COPD and its sequelae were estimated at \$32.1 billion, and total absenteeism costs were \$3.9 billion, for a total burden of COPD-attributable costs of \$36 billion. An estimated 16.4 million days of work were lost because of COPD. Of the medical costs, 18\% was paid for by private insurance, 51\% by Medicare, and 25\% by Medicaid. National medical costs are projected to increase from \$32.1 billion in 2010 to \$49.0 billion in 2020. Total state-specific costs in 2010 ranged from \$49.1 million in Wyoming to \$2.8 billion in California: medical costs ranged from \$42.5 million in Alaska to \$2.5 billion in Florida and absenteeism costs ranged from \$8.4 million in Wyoming to \$434.0 million in California.CONCLUSIONS:
Costs attributable to COPD and its sequelae are substantial and are projected to increase through 2020. Evidence-based interventions that prevent tobacco use and reduce the clinical complications of COPD may result in potential decreased COPD-attributable costs.},

Few studies have prospectively evaluated COPD comorbidities and mortality risk.Objectives: To prospectively evaluate COPD comorbidities and mortality risk.Methods: We followed 1,664 patients with COPD in five centers for a median of 51 months. Systematically, 79 comorbidities were recorded. We calculated mortality risk using Cox proportional hazard, and developed a graphic representation of the prevalence and strength of association to mortality in the form of a “comorbidome.” A COPD comorbidity index (COPD specific comorbidity test [COTE]) was constructed based on the comorbidities that increase mortality risk using a multivariate analysis. We tested the COTE index as predictor of mortality and explored whether the COTE index added predictive information when used with the validated BODE index.Measurements and Main Results: Fifteen of 79 comorbidities differed in prevalence between survivors and nonsurvivors. Of those, 12 predicted mortality and were integrated into the COTE index. Increases in the COTE index were associated with an increased risk of death from COPD-related (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95\% confidence interval, 1.08–1.18; P {\textless} 0.001) and non–COPD-related causes (HR, 1.18; 95\% confidence interval, 1.15–1.21; P {\textless} 0.001). Further, increases in the BODE and COTE were independently associated with increased risk of death. A COTE score of greater than or equal to 4 points increased by 2.2-fold the risk of death (HR, 2.26–2.68; P {\textless} 0.001) in all BODE quartile.Conclusions: Comorbidities are frequent in COPD and 12 of them negatively influence survival.

Results of epidemiological studies have shown that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is frequently associated with comorbidities, the most serious and prevalent being cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, osteoporosis, muscle weakness, and cachexia. Mechanistically, environmental risk factors such as smoking, unhealthy diet, exacerbations, and physical inactivity or inherent factors such as genetic background and ageing contribute to this association. No convincing evidence has been provided to suggest that treatment of COPD would reduce comorbidities, although some indirect indications are available. Clear evidence that treatment of comorbidities improves COPD is also lacking, although observational studies would suggest such an effect for statins, β blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme blockers and receptor antagonists. Large-scale prospective studies are needed. Reduction of common risk factors seems to be the most powerful approach to reduce comorbidities. Whether reduction of so-called spill-over of local inflammation from the lungs or systemic inflammation with inhaled or systemic anti-inflammatory drugs, respectively, would also reduce COPD-related comorbidities is doubtful.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:
The information on usual care for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in primary care is limited in Canada.

OBJECTIVE:
To evaluate primary care practice in patients with COPD in Quebec and Ontario compared with recommended care.

METHODS:
The COPD Care Gap Evaluation (CAGE) was a prospective, cross-sectional study. Physicians’ self-reported data of enrolled COPD patients were compared with the recommended care for the level of disease severity (using the Canadian Thoracic Society classification by symptoms) and stability, derived from Canadian Thoracic Society COPD guidelines. Pharmacological treatment, spirometric confirmation of diagnosis and nonpharmacological management, including smoking cessation counselling, influenza immunization and referral for pulmonary rehabilitation, were assessed.

RESULTS:
Participating physicians (n=161; 44 in Quebec, 117 in Ontario) recruited 1090 patients (320 in Quebec, 770 in Ontario). The mean (± SD) age of the patients was 69.9±10.4 years; 60\% were male and 40\% were currently smoking. Pharmacological treatment that matched guideline recommendations was identified in 34\% of patients. Discrepancies between reported and recommended treatment stemmed from nonprescription of long-acting bronchodilators (LABDs) for patients with moderate (27\%) and severe (21\%) COPD, nonprescription of two long-acting beta agonists (a beta2-agonist and an anticholinergic) for patients with severe COPD (51\%), and prescription of inhaled corticosteroids (63\%) and LABDs (47\%) for patients with mild COPD for which the treatment is not recommended. Spirometric confirmation of diagnosis, as recommended by the guidelines, was reported in 56\% of patients. For non-pharmacological management, smoking cessation counselling (95\%) and influenza immunization (80\%) were near optimal. Referral for pulmonary rehabilitation (9\%) was not common. Differences between provinces were seen mainly in the prescription of short-acting bronchodilators (89\% in Quebec, 76\% in Ontario) and LABDs (60\% in Quebec, 80\% in Ontario).

CONCLUSIONS:
Substantial gaps between recommended and current care exist in the management of COPD patients in primary care practice. Undertreatment of patients with severe COPD has potential clinical implications, including loss of autonomy and hospitalization.},

Aside from information on prevalence, mortality and hospital resource utilization arising from COPD in Canada, there is a lack of data on the impact of the disease on primary care healthcare resource utilization and the economic burden of the disease (i.e. direct and indirect costs). Canada is not unusual in this respect, as surprisingly few studies have attempted to quantify the impact of COPD on the healthcare system and society in other countries. In an attempt to address the need for information on the burden of COPD, an economic analysis of data from a large-scale international survey, Confronting COPD in North America and Europe, was conducted in Canada and six other countries. The results of the Canadian survey estimated the direct cost of the disease at CA dollar 1997.81 per patient, with over half of this due to inpatient hospitalizations. COPD also had an impact on the economy, with indirect costs amounting to CA dollar 1198.18, a third of the total per patient cost of COPD to society (CA dollar 3195.97). Reducing the impact of this disease will necessitate improvements to the way the disease is managed in primary care, as poor symptom control and frequent exacerbations are key drivers of hospital and other unscheduled care costs. Early diagnosis and the application of available but underused interventions (e.g. smoking cessation, inhaled drug therapies and pulmonary rehabilitation) could reduce the morbidity and costs of COPD in this country.},

OBJECTIVE: To measure the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its risk factors, investigate variation in prevalence across countries and develop standardized methods that can be used in industrialized and developing countries.
DESIGN: Non-institutionalized adults aged {\textgreater} or =40 years were recruited using population-based sampling plans. Each site targeted a minimum of 600 participants (300 women, 300 men), who filled out questionnaires and performed spirometry before and after administration of 200 mug salbutamol using standardized methods. Random effects meta-analysis models were used to estimate pooled prevalence estimates and risk factor effects and to test for heterogeneity across sites and sex.
RESULTS: Data published from 12 sites (n = 8775) showed that the estimated population prevalence of COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] Stage II and higher) was 10.1 +/- SE = 4.8\% overall (11.8 +/- 7.9\% for men and 8.5 +/- 5.8\% for women). Prevalence increased with age and pack-years of smoking, but other less understood risk factors, such as biomass heating and cooking exposures, occupational exposures and tuberculosis, also contribute to the location-specific variations in disease prevalence that BOLD is finding.
CONCLUSION: BOLD has estimated the social and economic burden of COPD in 12 countries to date. BOLD and the Proyecto Latinoamericano de Investigación en Obstrucción Pulmonar (the PLATINO study) are developing a growing database of COPD prevalence. Cigarette smoking and age are the most important COPD risk factors, but other risk factors should also be explored.},

	abstract = {Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is mostly managed within primary care, but there is little Canadian evidence from this setting. This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of physician-diagnosed COPD in primary care practices, and the degree of comorbidity with other chronic conditions, and to assess patterns of medication prescribing.
Methods The Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network is a national “network of networks” whose member practices use electronic medical records (EMRs). At the time of the study, it included data from 444 physicians from 10 networks in 8 provinces. We conducted an epidemiologic cohort study of all patients who had EMR data collected by the network at the end of 2012. Validated case-finding algorithms were used to identify cases of COPD. We used descriptive statistics and multivariate modelling analyses to calculate the prevalence of COPD, its association with key demographic factors and comorbidities, and patterns of medication prescribing.
Results The observed prevalence of COPD was 4.0\% (10 043/250 346), which represents a population prevalence of 3.4\% using age-sex standardization. Comorbidity was common, with prevalence ratios ranging from 1.1 for the presence of a single comorbid condition to 1.9 for 4 or more comorbid conditions. Anticholinergic agents (63\%), short- (48\%) and long-acting (38\%) β-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids (41\%) were the most commonly used medications.
Interpretation The prevalence of physician-diagnosed COPD in Canadian primary care practices was similar to that reported in other practice-based studies at about 3\%–4\%. Most patients had comorbid conditions and were taking multiple medications. EMR data may be useful to assess both the epidemiology and management of COPD in primary care practices.},

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents an increasing burden throughout the world. COPD-related mortality is probably underestimated because of the difficulties associated with identifying the precise cause of death. Respiratory failure is considered the major cause of death in advanced COPD. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and lung cancer are also major causes and, in mild-to-moderate COPD, are the leading causes of mortality. The links between COPD and these conditions are not fully understood. However, a link through the inflammation pathway has been suggested, as persistent low-grade pulmonary and systemic inflammation, both known risk factors for cardiovascular disease and cancer, are present in COPD independent of cigarette smoking. Lung-specific measurements, such as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), predict mortality in COPD and in the general population. However, composite tools, such as health-status measurements (e.g. St George's Respiratory Questionnaire) and the BODE index, which incorporates Body mass index, lung function (airflow Obstruction), Dyspnoea and Exercise capacity, predict mortality better than FEV(1) alone. These multidimensional tools may be more valuable because, unlike predictive approaches based on single parameters, they can reflect the range of comorbidities and the complexity of underlying mechanisms associated with COPD. The current paper reviews the role of comorbidities in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality, the putative underlying pathogenic link between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and comorbid conditions (i.e. inflammation), and the tools used to predict chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality.},

The objective of this study is to compare consistency with Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines, as well as rate, health care utilization, and hospital outcomes of severe acute exacerbation (AE) of COPD patients managed by pulmonologists and internists.

Materials and methods
This is a 12-month prospective, comparative observational study among 208 COPD patients who were regularly managed by pulmonologists (Group A) and internists (Group B). Clinical data, health care utilization, and hospital outcomes of the two groups were statistically compared.

Results
Out of 208 enrolled patients, 137 (Group A) and 71 (Group B) were managed by pulmonologists and internists, respectively. Pharmacological treatment corresponding to disease severity stages between the two groups was not statistically different. Group A received care consistent with guidelines in terms of annual influenza vaccination (31.4\% vs 9.9\%, P{\textless}0.001) and pulmonary rehabilitation (24.1\% vs 0\%, P{\textless}0.001) greater than Group B. Group A had reduced rates (12.4\% vs 23.9\%, P=0.033) and numbers of severe AE (0.20±0.63 person-years vs 0.41±0.80 person-years, P=0.029). Among patients with severe AE requiring mechanical ventilation, Group A had reduced mechanical ventilator duration (1.5 [1–7] days vs 5 [3–29] days, P=0.005), hospital length of stay (3.5 [1–20] days vs 16 [6–29] days, P=0.012), and total hospital cost (\$863 [247–2,496] vs \$2,095 [763–6,792], P=0.049) as compared with Group B.

Conclusion
This study demonstrated that pulmonologists followed national COPD guidelines more closely than internists. The rates and frequencies of severe AE were significantly lower in patients managed by pulmonologists, and length of hospital stay and cost were significantly lower among the patients with severe AE who required mechanical ventilation.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Whether patients with acute myocardial infarction who are treated by cardiologists have better outcomes than patients treated by generalist physicians is controversial. Because some of the survival benefit associated with cardiology care may be due to baseline differences in patient characteristics, we evaluated how differences in case-mix of comorbid illness and functional limitations may explain the association between specialty care and survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the records of 109,243 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for myocardial infarction from 1994 to 1995 from the national Cooperative Cardiovascular Project to evaluate the association of physician specialty with 30-day and 1-year mortality. We assessed the extent to which this relation was mediated by differences in the use of guideline-supported therapies (aspirin, beta-blockers, reperfusion, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) or differences in the clinical characteristics of the patients.
RESULTS: Patients who had board-certified cardiologists as attending physicians had the least number of comorbid conditions, whereas patients who had general practitioners or internal medicine subspecialists as attending physicians usually had the most comorbidities. Cardiologists had the greatest use of most guideline-supported therapies, and general practitioners had the lowest use. After adjustment for severity of myocardial infarction, clinical presentation, and hospital characteristics, patients treated by cardiologists were less likely to die within 1 year (relative risk [RR] = 0.92, 95\%, confidence interval [CI]: 0.89 to 0. 95), and patients cared for by other general practitioners were more likely to die within 1 year (RR = 1.09, 95\% CI: 1.03 to 1.14), than patients cared for by general internists. After adjusting for additional measures of comorbid illness and functional limitations, the 1-year survival benefit associated with cardiology care was attenuated relative to internists (RR = 0.97, 95\% CI: 0.94 to 1.0), and the excess mortality associated with general practitioners decreased (RR = 1.05, 95\% CI: 1.00 to 1.11). After further adjustment for the use of guideline-supported therapies, both differences in 1-year survival between patients treated by cardiologists or general practitioners were not significantly different from those of patients treated by internists.
CONCLUSION: Studies comparing outcomes by physician specialties that do not adjust adequately for differences in patient characteristics may attribute more benefit than is appropriate to specialists who treat patients who have fewer comorbid conditions. Some of the remaining benefit-at least among patients with myocardial infarction-may be attributable to greater use of recommended therapies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Although many specialists serve as primary care physicians (PCPs), the type of patients they serve, the range of services they provide, and the quality of care they deliver is uncertain.

OBJECTIVE
To describe trends in patient, physician, and visit characteristics, and compare visit-based quality for visits to generalists and specialists self-identified as PCPs.

DESIGN
Cross-sectional study and time trend analysis.

DATA
Nationally representative sample of visits to office-based physicians from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 1997–2010.

MAIN MEASURES
Proportions of primary care visits to generalist and specialists, patient characteristics, principal diagnoses, and quality.

KEY RESULTS
Among 84,041 visits to self-identified PCPs representing an estimated 4.0 billion visits, 91.5 \% were to generalists, 5.9 \% were to medical specialists and 2.6 \% were to obstetrician/gynecologists. The proportion of PCP visits to generalists increased from 88.4 \% in 1997 to 92.4 \% in 2010, but decreased for medical specialists from 8.0 \% to 4.8 \%, p = 0.04). The proportion of medical specialist visits in which the physician self-identified as the patient’s PCP decreased from 30.6 \% in 1997 to 9.8 \% in 2010 (p {\textless} 0.01). Medical specialist PCPs take care of older patients (mean age 61 years), and dedicate most of their visits to chronic disease management (51.0 \%), while generalist PCPs see younger patients (mean age 55.4 years) most commonly for new problems (40.5 \%). Obstetrician/gynecologists self-identified as PCPs see younger patients (mean age 38.3 p {\textless} 0.01), primarily for preventive care (54.0 \%, p {\textless} 0.01). Quality of care for cardiovascular disease was better in visits to cardiologists than in visits to generalists, but was similar or better in visits to generalists compared to visits to other medical specialists.

CONCLUSIONS
Medical specialists are less frequently serving as PCPs for their patients over time. Generalist, medical specialist, and obstetrician/gynecologist PCPs serve different primary care roles for different populations. Delivery redesign efforts must account for the evolving role of generalist and specialist PCPs in the delivery of primary care.

costs of a cohort of 413 patients with COPD are reported.Design: This study was a retrospective pharmacoeconomic
analysis.Setting: University teaching hospital and
affiliated clinics.Patients: COPD patients with an
FEV1 {\textless} 65\% of predicted and an FEV1/FVC
ratio {\textless} 70\% were eligible to be included in this analysis.Interventions: Health-care resource utilization and costs
were identified through chart review and were stratified according to
the severity of COPD using the American Thoracic Society stages I, II,
and III. The pharmacoeconomic analysis was a cost-of-illness evaluation
that included the acquisition costs of initially prescribed pulmonary
drugs, acquisition cost of pulmonary drugs added during the follow-up
period, oxygen therapy, laboratory and diagnostic test costs, clinic
visit costs, and emergency department and hospital costs.Results: Total treatment cost was highly correlated with
disease severity, with stage I COPD having the lowest cost (\$1,681 per
patient per year), stage III COPD having the highest cost (\$10,812 per
patient per year), and stage II COPD having a cost intermediate to
stage I and stage III (\$5,037 per patient per year). With the exception
of add-on drug acquisition cost, all cost variables were the highest in
stage III COPD, the lowest in stage I COPD, and intermediate in stage
II COPD. Hospitalization was the most important cost variable for all
three stages of COPD severity. When stratified by both disease severity
and initial bronchodilator drug selection, ipratropium alone in stage I
COPD patients and the combination of ipratropium plus a β-agonist
(with or without steroid therapy) in stage II and stage III COPD
patients had the lowest total costs. Reasons for the lower total cost
of the ipratropium and ipratropium plus β-agonist treatment groups
included lower add-on drug costs, fewer diagnostic and laboratory
tests, and a lower utilization rate for clinic visits, emergency
department visits, and hospitalizations.Conclusions:
Our study demonstrates a strong correlation between disease severity
and total treatment cost in COPD. In addition, the type of
bronchodilator therapy impacts total cost in COPD. In stage I COPD,
ipratropium alone had the lowest total cost, while in stage II and
stage III COPD, a combination of ipratropium plus a β-agonist had the
lowest total cost. These data support the concept that adherence to
published treatment guidelines will result in lower health-care costs
due to COPD.},

Both societies felt the need to update the previous documents due to the following. 1) The prevalence and overall importance of COPD as a health problem is increasing. 2) There have been enough advances in the field to require an update, especially adapted to the particular needs of the ATS/ERS constituency. 3) It allows for the creation of a “live” modular document based on the web; it should provide healthcare professionals and patients with a user friendly and reliable authoritative source of information. 4) The care of COPD should be comprehensive, is often multidisciplinary and rapidly changing. 5) Both the ATS and the ERS acknowledge the recent dissemination of the Global Initiative of Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 3 as a major worldwide contribution to the battle against COPD. However, some specific requirements of the members of both societies require adaptation of the broad GOLD initiative. Those requirements include specific recommendations on oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, noninvasive ventilation, surgery in and for COPD, sleep, air travel, and end-of-life. In addition, special emphasis has been placed on issues related to the habit of smoking and its control.

The main goals of the updated document are to improve the quality of care provided to patients with COPD and to develop the project using a disease-oriented approach.

Proactive diagnosis and ongoing multifactorial COPD management, comprising smoking cessation, influenza and pneumonia vaccinations, pulmonary rehabilitation, and symptomatic and maintenance pharmacotherapy according to severity, can significantly improve a patient’s health-related quality of life, reduce exacerbations and their consequences, and alleviate the functional, utilization, and financial burden of COPD. Redesign of primary care according to principles of the chronic care model, which is implemented in the patient-centered medical home, can shift COPD management from acute rescue to proactive maintenance. The chronic care model and patient-centered medical home combine delivery system redesign, clinical information systems, decision support, and self-management support within a practice, linked with health care organization and community resources beyond the practice. COPD care programs implementing two or more chronic care model components effectively reduce emergency room and inpatient utilization. This review guides primary care practices in improving COPD care workflows, highlighting the contributions of multidisciplinary collaborative team care, care coordination, and patient engagement. Each primary care practice can devise a COPD care workflow addressing risk awareness, spirometric diagnosis, guideline-based treatment and rehabilitation, and self-management support, to improve patient outcomes in COPD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cost of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has not been well studied. The aim of this study was to identify and quantify the (average) cost of moderate and severe exacerbations (ME and SE, respectively) from a Canadian perspective.
METHODS: Resources used during ME and SE were identified in a year long prospective, observational study (Resource Utilization Study In COPD (RUSIC)). The units of analysis were ME and SE. Unit costs (2006\$CAN), based on provincial, hospital and published sources, were applied to resources. The overall cost per ME and SE were calculated. The population burden of exacerbations was also calculated.
RESULTS: Among study participants (N=609, aged 68.6+/-9.4 years, 58.3\% male) there were 790 exacerbations: 639 (80.9\%) MEs and 151 (19.1\%) SEs. Of the 790 exacerbations, 618 (78.2\%), 245 (31.0\%) and 151 (19.1\%) included a visit to an outpatient clinic, emergency department (ED) or hospital, respectively. For ME, 85.9\% and 13.1\% involved visits to GPs and respirologists, respectively. Pharmacologic treatment changes in the outpatient setting involved antibiotics (63.1\%) and corticosteroids (34.7\%). The overall mean costs for outpatient and ED services for MEs were \$126 (N=574) and \$515 (N=105), respectively. The average overall cost of a ME was \$641. For SEs, the average hospital stay was 10.0 days. The overall mean costs of outpatient, ED and hospitalization services for SE were \$114 (N=44), \$774 (N=140) and \$8669 (N=151), respectively. The average overall cost of a SE was \$9557.
CONCLUSION: The economic burden associated with MEs and especially SEs, in Canada, is considerable and likely has a substantial impact on healthcare costs. The overall burden of exacerbations has been estimated in the range of \$646 million to \$736 million per annum.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder associated with increased comorbid prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to quantify the magnitudes of association between overall and specific types of cardiovascular disease, major cardiovascular risk factors, and COPD.
METHODS: We searched Cochrane, Medline, and Embase databases for studies published between Jan 1, 1980, and April 30, 2015, on the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors in patients with COPD versus matched controls or random samples from the general public. We assessed associations with random-effects meta-analyses. We studied heterogeneity and biases with random-effects meta-regressions, jackknife sensitivity analyses, assessment of funnel plots, and Egger tests.
FINDINGS: We identified 18,176 unique references and included 29 datasets in the meta-analyses. Compared with the non-COPD population, patients with COPD were more likely to be diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (odds ratio [OR] 2·46; 95\% CI 2·02-3·00; p{\textless}0·0001), including a two to five times higher risk of ischaemic heart disease, cardiac dysrhythmia, heart failure, diseases of the pulmonary circulation, and diseases of the arteries. Additionally, patients with COPD reported hypertension more often (OR 1·33, 95\% CI 1·13-1·56; p=0·0007), diabetes (1·36, 1·21-1·53; p{\textless}0·0001], and ever smoking (4·25, 3·23-5·60; p{\textless}0·0001). The associations between COPD and these cardiovascular disease types and cardiovascular disease risk factors were consistent and valid across studies. Enrolment period, age, quality of data, and COPD diagnosis partly explained the heterogeneity.
INTERPRETATION: The coexistence of COPD, cardiovascular disease, and major risk factors for cardiovascular disease highlights the crucial need for the development of strategies to screen for and reduce cardiovascular risks associated with COPD.

	abstract = {COPD is currently one of the leading causes of hospitalizations in industrialized countries. The future burden of COPD is uncertain as the trends in the prevalence of the main risk factors for COPD, namely cigarette smoking and population aging, are moving in opposite directions in many jurisdictions. Here, we used data from British Columbia (BC), a Canadian Province of 4.7 million people, as an exemplary jurisdiction to illustrate the projected growth of COPD hospitalizations over the next 15 years in developed countries. We combined forecasts of population growth and aging with an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model applied to BC's population-based administrative health databases (2001 to 2010) to project the trends in the incidence, prevalence, deaths, and total length of inpatient stays to 2030. Based on this model, we predict that the absolute number of COPD cases will increase by more than 150\% from 2010 to 2030 with the greatest growth in the older age group (75 years of age and older), where the absolute number will increase by 220\%. The burden of inpatient care, measured as the total annual inpatient days, will grow by 185\%. Assuming no disruptive changes in the prevention and the treatment of COPD in the near future, the burden of COPD, especially the burden of inpatient care, will significantly escalate over the next 15 years, driven predominantly by population aging. There is a pressing need to develop new preventive strategies and treatments to reduce the future burden of COPD.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Although diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent and costly chronic diseases in the United States, no estimates have been published of individuals' average lifetime risk of developing diabetes.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-specific lifetime risk of diabetes in the cohort born in 2000 in the United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data from the National Health Interview Survey (1984-2000) were used to estimate age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-specific prevalence and incidence in 2000. US Census Bureau data and data from a previous study of diabetes as a cause of death were used to estimate age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-specific mortality rates for diabetic and nondiabetic populations.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Residual (remaining) lifetime risk of diabetes (from birth to 80 years in 1-year intervals), duration with diabetes, and life-years and quality-adjusted life-years lost from diabetes.
RESULTS: The estimated lifetime risk of developing diabetes for individuals born in 2000 is 32.8\% for males and 38.5\% for females. Females have higher residual lifetime risks at all ages. The highest estimated lifetime risk for diabetes is among Hispanics (males, 45.4\% and females, 52.5\%). Individuals diagnosed as having diabetes have large reductions in life expectancy. For example, we estimate that if an individual is diagnosed at age 40 years, men will lose 11.6 life-years and 18.6 quality-adjusted life-years and women will lose 14.3 life-years and 22.0 quality-adjusted life-years.
CONCLUSIONS: For individuals born in the United States in 2000, the lifetime probability of being diagnosed with diabetes mellitus is substantial. Primary prevention of diabetes and its complications are important public health priorities.},

Population-based health administrative databases provide a powerful and unbiased way of studying COPD in the population, however, their ability to accurately identify patients with this disease must first be confirmed. The objective was to validate population-based health administrative definitions of COPD. Previously abstracted medical records of adults over the age of 35 randomly selected from primary care practices in Ontario, Canada were reviewed by an expert panel to establish if an individual did or did not have a diagnosis of COPD. These reference designations were then linked to each individual's respective health administrative database record and compared with predefine health administrative data definitions of COPD. Concepts of diagnostic test evaluation were used to calculate and compare their test characteristics. The most sensitive health administrative definition of COPD was 1 or more ambulatory claims and/or 1 or more hospitalizations for COPD that yielded a sensitivity of 85.0\% (95\% confidence interval 77.0 to 91.0) and a specificity of 78.4\% (95\% confidence interval 73.6 to 82.7). As number of ambulatory claims in the definition increased, sensitivity decreased and specificity increased. Individuals with COPD can be accurately identified in health administrative data, and therefore it may be used to create an unbiased population cohort for surveillance and research. This offers a powerful means of generating evidence to inform strategies that optimize the prevention and management of COPD.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are afflicted by comorbidities. Few studies have prospectively evaluated COPD comorbidities and mortality risk.
OBJECTIVES: To prospectively evaluate COPD comorbidities and mortality risk.
METHODS: We followed 1,664 patients with COPD in five centers for a median of 51 months. Systematically, 79 comorbidities were recorded. We calculated mortality risk using Cox proportional hazard, and developed a graphic representation of the prevalence and strength of association to mortality in the form of a "comorbidome". A COPD comorbidity index (COPD specific comorbidity test [COTE]) was constructed based on the comorbidities that increase mortality risk using a multivariate analysis. We tested the COTE index as predictor of mortality and explored whether the COTE index added predictive information when used with the validated BODE index.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifteen of 79 comorbidities differed in prevalence between survivors and nonsurvivors. Of those, 12 predicted mortality and were integrated into the COTE index. Increases in the COTE index were associated with an increased risk of death from COPD-related (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95\% confidence interval, 1.08-1.18; P {\textless} 0.001) and non-COPD-related causes (HR, 1.18; 95\% confidence interval, 1.15-1.21; P {\textless} 0.001). Further, increases in the BODE and COTE were independently associated with increased risk of death. A COTE score of greater than or equal to 4 points increased by 2.2-fold the risk of death (HR, 2.26-2.68; P {\textless} 0.001) in all BODE quartile.
CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities are frequent in COPD and 12 of them negatively influence survival. A simple disease-specific comorbidities index (COTE) helps assess mortality risk in patients with COPD.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: A diagnosis of asthma is considered an independent risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, little is known about health service use patterns in patients with COPD who have a history of asthma in comparison with those without such a history, especially regarding comorbid conditions.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the excess costs of COPD in patients with a history of asthma (COPD+asthma) versus those with COPD without such a history (COPD-only); to estimate excess costs attributable to inpatient care, outpatient care, medications, and community care; and to estimate excess costs attributable to comorbid conditions.
METHODS: We used vital statistics, inpatient and outpatient encounters, filled prescription records, and community care data of patients in British Columbia, Canada, from 1997 to 2012 to create propensity score-matched COPD+asthma and COPD-only cohorts. We calculated and compared the excess medical costs (in 2012 Canadian dollars [\$]) between the two groups on the basis of billing information. Comorbidities were ascertained from the inpatient and outpatient records and were classified on the basis of major categories of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 22,565 individuals within each group (mean age at baseline, 67.9 yr; 57.0\% female; average follow-up, 4.07 yr). Excess costs of COPD+asthma were \$540.7 per patient-year (PY) (95\% confidence interval [CI], \$301.7-\$779.8; P {\textless} 0.001). Costs of medications (\$657.9/PY; P {\textless} 0.001) and outpatient services (\$127.6/PY; P {\textless} 0.001) were higher in COPD+asthma, but costs of hospitalizations were lower (-\$271.0/PY; P = 0.002). Community care costs in the two groups were similar (P = 0.257). The excess cost of respiratory-related conditions was \$856.2/PY (P {\textless} 0.001), with \$552.6/PY being due to respiratory-related medications (P {\textless} 0.001); costs of all other conditions combined were lower in COPD+asthma, mainly due to lower costs of cardiovascular diseases (-\$201.8/PY; P {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD with a previous history of asthma consume more health care resources than those with COPD alone, but there are important differences in cost components and costs attributable to comorbid conditions. Further research is required to examine whether the lower costs of cardiovascular disease in these patients is due to lower levels of related risk factors or to intrinsic differences in COPD phenotypes.},

We thought to assess the risk of asthma-related hospitalisation in individuals who regularly filled prescriptions for ICS+LABA compared to those who regularly filled prescriptions for ICS alone or LABA alone, and compared to those who did not regularly fill such medications.
METHODS: Using administrative health databases of the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, from 1997 to 2012, we conducted a nested case-control analysis of a cohort of asthma patients. Cases were defined as those who experienced asthma-related hospitalisation after the first year of their entry into the cohort. For each case, up to 20 controls were matched based on age, sex, date of cohort entry, and several measures of asthma severity. We categorised individuals as regularly exposed, irregularly exposed, or non-exposed to ICS alone, LABA alone, or ICS+LABA based on dispensation records in the past 12 months. The primary outcome measures were the rate ratio (RR) of the asthma-related hospitalisation among categories of regular exposure.
RESULTS: 3319 cases were matched to 43 023 controls. The RR for regular dispensation of ICS+LABA was 1.14 (95\% CI 0.93 to 1.41) compared with regular dispensation of ICS alone and 0.45 (95\% CI 0.29 to 0.70) compared with regular dispensation of LABA alone. Those who regularly dispensed LABA had to dispense an ICS for at least three quarters of a year to reduce their risk to that of those who did not dispense LABA.
CONCLUSIONS: Regular dispensation of ICS+LABA was not associated with an increased risk of asthma-related hospitalisation compared with regular dispensation of ICS alone. Adherence to ICS in patients who regularly receive ICS+LABA seems to be an important factor in the prevention of adverse asthma-related outcomes.},

	issn = {0040-6376},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inhaled corticosteroids are effective at preventing asthma morbidity and mortality. Most studies, however, have focused on short term effects, raising uncertainty about their effectiveness in the long term.
METHODS: The Saskatchewan Health databases were used to form two population based cohorts of asthma patients aged 5-44 between 1975 and 1991. The first cohort included all subjects from the start of asthma treatment, while the second included subjects hospitalised for asthma from the date of discharge. Subjects were followed up, starting 1 year after cohort entry and continuing until 1997, 54 years of age, or death. The outcome was the first asthma hospital admission and readmission, respectively, to occur during follow up. A nested case-control design was used by which all cases were matched on calendar time and several markers of asthma severity to all available controls within the cohort.
RESULTS: The full cohort included 30 569 asthmatic subjects of which 3894 were admitted to hospital for asthma and 1886 were readmitted. The overall rate of asthma hospitalisation was 42.4 per 1000 asthma patients per year. Regular use of inhaled corticosteroids was associated with reductions of 31\% in the rate of hospital admissions for asthma (95\% confidence interval (CI) 17 to 43) and 39\% in the rate of readmission (95\% CI 25 to 50). The rate reduction found during the first 4 years of follow up was sustained over the longer term. Regular use of inhaled corticosteroids can potentially prevent between five hospital admissions and 27 readmissions per 1000 asthma patients per year.
CONCLUSION: Regular use of low dose inhaled corticosteroids prevents a large proportion of hospital admissions with asthma, both early and later on in the course of the disease.},

	abstract = {Clinical studies are often faced with the difficult problem of how to account for participants who die without experiencing the study outcome of interest. In a geriatric population with considerable co-morbidities, the competing risk of death is especially high. Traditional approaches to describe risk of disease include Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression; however, these methods can overestimate risk of disease by failing to account for the competing risk of death. In this report, we discuss traditional survival analysis and competing risk analysis as used to estimate risk of disease in geriatric studies. Furthermore, we provide an illustration of a competing risk approach to estimate risk of second hip fracture in the Framingham Osteoporosis Study, and we compare the results with traditional survival analysis. In this example, survival analysis overestimated the five-year risk of second hip fracture by 37\% and the ten-year risk by 75\% compared with competing risk estimates. We conclude, that in studies of older individuals in which a substantial number of participants die during a long follow-up, the Cumulative Incidence Competing Risk (CICR) estimate and Competing Risk Regression (CRR) should be used to determine incidence and effect estimates. Use of a competing risk approach is critical to accurately determine disease risk for elderly individuals, and therefore best inform clinical decision-making.},

Exacerbations in chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) are sensitive to seasonal variations in exposure to respiratory infectious agents and allergens and patient factors such as non-adherence. Hence, regular general practitioner (GP) contact is likely to be important in order to recognise symptom escalation early and adjust treatment.

OBJECTIVE
To examine the association of regularity of GP visits with all-cause mortality and first CRD hospitalisation overall and within groups of pharmacotherapy level in older CRD patients.

DESIGN
A retrospective cohort design using linked hospital, mortality, Medicare and pharmaceutical data for participant, exposure and outcome ascertainment. GP visit pattern was measured during the first 3 years of the observation period. Patients were then followed for a maximum of 11.5 years for ascertainment of hospitalisations and deaths.

PARTICIPANTS
We studied 108,455 patients aged ≥65 years with CRD in Western Australia (WA) during 1992–2006.

MAIN MEASURES
A GP visit regularity score (range 0–1) was calculated and divided into quintiles. A clinician consensus panel classified levels of pharmacotherapy. Cox proportional hazards models, controlling for multiple factors including GP visit frequency, were used to calculate hazard ratios and confidence intervals.

KEY RESULTS
Differences in survival curves and hospital avoidance pattern between the GP visit regularity quintiles were statistically significant (p = 0.0279 and p {\textless} 0.0001, respectively). The protective association between GP visit regularity and death appeared to be confined to the highest pharmacotherapy level group (P for interaction = 0.0001). Higher GP visit regularity protected against first CRD hospitalisation compared with the least regular quintile regardless of pharmacotherapy level (medium regular: HR = 0.84, 95\% CI = 0.77–0.92; 2nd most regular: HR = 0.74, 95\% CI = 0.67–0.82; most regular HR = 0.77, 95\% CI = 0.68–0.86).

CONCLUSIONS
The findings indicate that regular and proactive ‘maintenance’ primary care, as distinct from ‘reactive’ care, is beneficial to older CRD patients by reducing their risks of hospitalisation and death.

Population-based health administrative databases provide a powerful and unbiased way of studying COPD in the population, however, their ability to accurately identify patients with this disease must first be confirmed. The objective was to validate population-based health administrative definitions of COPD. Previously abstracted medical records of adults over the age of 35 randomly selected from primary care practices in Ontario, Canada were reviewed by an expert panel to establish if an individual did or did not have a diagnosis of COPD. These reference designations were then linked to each individual's respective health administrative database record and compared with predefine health administrative data definitions of COPD. Concepts of diagnostic test evaluation were used to calculate and compare their test characteristics. The most sensitive health administrative definition of COPD was 1 or more ambulatory claims and/or 1 or more hospitalizations for COPD that yielded a sensitivity of 85.0\% (95\% confidence interval 77.0 to 91.0) and a specificity of 78.4\% (95\% confidence interval 73.6 to 82.7). As number of ambulatory claims in the definition increased, sensitivity decreased and specificity increased. Individuals with COPD can be accurately identified in health administrative data, and therefore it may be used to create an unbiased population cohort for surveillance and research. This offers a powerful means of generating evidence to inform strategies that optimize the prevention and management of COPD.},

Approximately 60 million people in the United States live with one of four chronic conditions: heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and major depression. Anxiety and depression are very common comorbidities in COPD and have significant impact on patients, their families, society, and the course of the disease.

Methods
We report the proceedings of a multidisciplinary workshop on anxiety and depression in COPD that aimed to shed light on the current understanding of these comorbidities, and outline unanswered questions and areas of future research needs.

Results
Estimates of prevalence of anxiety and depression in COPD vary widely but are generally higher than those reported in some other advanced chronic diseases. Untreated and undetected anxiety and depressive symptoms may increase physical disability, morbidity, and health-care utilization. Several patient, physician, and system barriers contribute to the underdiagnosis of these disorders in patients with COPD. While few published studies demonstrate that these disorders associated with COPD respond well to appropriate pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy, only a small proportion of COPD patients with these disorders receive effective treatment.

Conclusion
Future research is needed to address the impact, early detection, and management of anxiety and depression in COPD.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to examine the state of knowledge and clinical practice in the association of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to osteoporosis and fracture incidence.
RECENT FINDINGS: There is a clear association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and excessive bone loss/risk of fractures. Little is known about the pathophysiological processes involved in the bone loss, but recent reports point to a continuous systemic inflammatory state in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This inflammation involves the release of inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1. During the course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a protein catabolic process takes place, including increased production of catalytic enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases etc.), which together with the inflammatory cytokines induces bone resorption.
SUMMARY: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are at increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Risk factors such as smoking, advanced age, physical inactivity, malnutrition, and low weight may be responsible, but a number of pathophysiological explanations including the presence of a chronic inflammatory state with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and protein catalytic enzymes may also be involved. The use of oral glucocorticoids is also a significant risk factor. Increased awareness is highly warranted to diagnose osteoporosis at an early stage, and professionals should be aware of the risk of osteoporosis in this patient population.},

\#\#\# Summary

⇓Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA, and it remains one of the few diseases that continues to increase its numbers. The development and progression of COPD can vary dramatically between individuals. A low level of lung function remains the cornerstone of COPD diagnosis and is a key predictor of prognosis. Lung function, however, is not the only factor in determining morbidity and mortality related to COPD, with factors such as body mass index, exercise capability and comorbid disease being important predictors of poor outcomes. Exacerbations of COPD are additional important indicators of both quality of life and outcomes in COPD patients. Definitions of exacerbations can vary, ranging from an increase in symptoms to COPD-related hospitalisations and death. COPD exacerbations are more common in patients with lower levels of lung function and may lead to more rapid declines in lung function. Better understanding of the natural history of COPD may lead to better definitions of specific COPD phenotypes, better interventions and improved outcomes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a growing economic burden worldwide. Smoking cessation is thought to be the single most effective way of reducing the economic burden of COPD. The impact of other strategies such as interventions that predict risk of disease, reduce progression of disease, or reduce exacerbations has not been systematically studied.
OBJECTIVES: We estimated the economic and clinical burden of COPD over the next 25 years in Canada and the impact of three potential interventions (screening test for predisposition to COPD, new drugs to avoid progression into more severe disease stages, and predictive test for exacerbations) on COPD burden.
METHODS: Using a dynamic simulation model, we projected the total burden of COPD (cost, morbidity, and mortality) from 2011 to 2035 using the population of Canada as a case study. The model stratified population based on sex, age, smoking status, respiratory symptoms, and their COPD stage. The cost and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with each intervention were estimated.
RESULTS: The model indicates that annual societal cost of COPD is \$4.52 billion (B) Canadian dollars in 2011 and will reach \$3.61B (\$7.33B undiscounted) per year in 2035. Over the next 25 years, COPD will be responsible for approximately \$101.4B in societal costs (\$147.5B undiscounted) and 12.9 million QALYs lost (19.0 million undiscounted). Our results suggested that the best strategy to reduce the financial burden of COPD is by reducing exacerbations. Smoking cessation, while it is the cornerstone of COPD prevention, has only a modest effect in attenuating the financial burden of COPD over the next 25 years in Western countries such as Canada.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that any intervention that can reduce the number of exacerbations has a substantial impact on morbidity and costs of COPD and should be considered in conjunction with the ongoing efforts to reduce smoking rates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe asthma is associated with disproportionately high morbidity, but little is known about its natural history and how risk factors at first year of diagnosis modify its subsequent development.
METHODS: Using administrative health data, we retrospectively followed patients 14-55 years of age with newly diagnosed severe asthma in British Columbia, Canada. Based on intensity of resource use (drug therapy) and occurrence of exacerbations, each patient-year was classified into mild, moderate, or severe asthma. We estimated the probability of transition between severity levels or to death over the study period using a four-state Markov model, and used this to assess the 10-year trajectory of severe asthma and the influence of baseline risk factors.
RESULTS: We followed 13 467 patients. Ten years after incident severe asthma, 83\% had transitioned to a less severe level (mild: 43\%, moderate: 40\%). Low socioeconomic status, high comorbidity burden, and high adherence (proportion of days covered (PDC) by asthma controller therapy) in the first year were independently associated with, respectively, 10\%, 24\% and 35\% more time in severe asthma over the next 10 years. Sex was not associated with the clinical course.
CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with incident severe asthma used fewer resources over time, indicating a long-term transition to milder asthma. Potentially modifiable risk factors for poor prognosis of severe asthma include low socioeconomic status and high comorbidity burden. The association between PDC and future asthma severity is likely due to residual confounding by disease severity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly coexist, increasing the risk of hospitalization and mortality compared to either condition alone. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of comorbid CVD on healthcare utilization and costs in a COPD population.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of COPD patients CVD ± ≥40 years of age using administrative claims data was conducted. COPD-CVD patients were matched to COPD patients without CVD (COPD-Only cohort) using propensity scores. Multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the 1-year risk of COPD exacerbations (hospitalization and/or emergency room [ER] visits), along with differences in 1-year and 2-year all-cause and COPD-related utilization and costs (2008 USD) among COPD-CVD and COPD-Only cohorts.
RESULTS: Each cohort included 4594 patients. Compared to COPD-Only cohort, the COPD-CVD cohort was almost 2 times more likely to require COPD-related hospitalization (odds ratio [OR], 1.95; p {\textless} 0.001), 47\% more likely to have an ER visit (OR, 1.47; p {\textless} 0.001) and 62\% more likely to require hospitalization and/or ER visit (OR, 1.62; p {\textless} 0.001). Average annual all-cause medical costs per patient were \$22,755 for COPD-CVD vs \$8036 for COPD-Only (p {\textless} 0.001), and total costs were \$27,032 vs \$11,506 (p {\textless} 0.001), respectively; corresponding average COPD-related annual medical costs were \$1891 vs \$1060 (p {\textless} 0.001) and total costs were \$3295 vs \$2379 (p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: COPD patients with CVD have significantly higher risk of COPD exacerbations and increased costs than COPD patients without CVD. This suggests a close association between COPD and CVD that warrants further exploration.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Long-acting beta(2)-agonists are prescribed for patients with persistent asthma and are sometimes used without inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). No evidence exists, however, to support their use as monotherapy in adults with persistent asthma.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of salmeterol xinafoate, a long-acting beta(2)-agonist, as replacement therapy in patients whose asthma is well controlled by low-dose triamcinolone acetonide, an ICS.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A 28-week, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial conducted at 6 National Institutes of Health-sponsored, university-based ambulatory care centers from February 1997 to January 1999.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-four patients aged 12 through 65 years with persistent asthma that was well controlled during a 6-week run-in period of treatment with inhaled triamcinolone (400 microg twice per day).
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to continue triamcinolone therapy (400 microg twice per day; n = 54) or switch to salmeterol (42 microg twice per day; n = 54) or to placebo (n = 56) for 16 weeks, after which all patients received placebo for an additional 6-week run-out period.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), self-assessed asthma symptom scores, rescue albuterol use, asthma-specific quality-of-life scores, treatment failure, asthma exacerbation, bronchial reactivity, and markers of airway inflammation, compared among the 3 treatment groups.
RESULTS: During the 16-week randomized treatment period, no significant differences between the salmeterol and triamcinolone groups were observed for conventional outcomes of clinical studies of asthma therapy-morning PEF, evening PEF, asthma symptom scores, rescue albuterol sulfate use, or quality of life. Both active treatments were superior to placebo. However, the salmeterol group had more treatment failures than the triamcinolone group (13/54 [24\%] vs 3/54 [6\%]; P =.004), as well as more asthma exacerbations (11/54 [20\%] vs 4/54 [7\%]; P =.04), greater increases in median (interquartile range) sputum eosinophils (2.4\% [0.0\% to 10.6\%] vs -0.1\% [-0.7\% to 0.3\%]; P{\textless}.001), eosinophil cationic protein (71 [-2 to 430] U/L vs -4 [-31 to 56] U/L; P =.005), and tryptase (3.1 [2.1 to 7.6] ng/mL vs 0.0 [0.0 to 0.7] ng/mL; P{\textless}.001). The duration of benefit when patients were switched from active treatment to placebo after 22 weeks of randomized treatment was not significantly longer in the triamcinolone group than in the salmeterol group.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with persistent asthma well controlled by low doses of triamcinolone cannot be switched to salmeterol monotherapy without risk of clinically significant loss of asthma control.},

The data are generally categorical and often quite skewed, violating distributional assumptions of standard normal-theory statistical models. In this paper, we present several currently-available modeling options, all of which make appropriate distributional assumptions for the observed categorical data. Three are based on the generalized linear model: a hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM), a growth mixture model (GMM), and a latent class growth analysis (LCGA). We also describe a longitudinal latent class analysis (LLCA), which requires fewer assumptions than the first three. Finally, we illustrate all of the models using actual longitudinal adolescent alcohol-use data. We guide the reader through the model-selection process, comparing the results in terms of convergence properties, fit and residuals, parsimony, and interpretability. Advances in computing and statistical software have made the tools for these types of analyses readily accessible to most researchers. Using appropriate models for categorical data will lead to more accurate and reliable results, and their application in real data settings could contribute to substantive advancements in the field of development and the science of prevention.},

	abstract = {Objectives
To compare different approaches to address ceiling effects when predicting EQ-5D index scores from the 10 subscales of the MOS-HIV Health Survey.

Study Design
Data were collected from an HIV treatment trial. Statistical methods included ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, the censored least absolute deviations (CLAD) approach, a standard two-part model (TPM), a TPM with a log-transformed EQ-5D index, and a latent class model (LCM). Predictive accuracy was evaluated using percentage of absolute error (R1) and squared error (R2) predicted by statistical methods.

Findings
A TPM with a log-transformed EQ-5D index performed best on R1; a LCM performed best on R2. In contrast, the CLAD was worst. Performance of the OLS and a standard TPM were intermediate. Values for R1 ranged from 0.33 (CLAD) to 0.42 (TPM-L); R2 ranged from 0.37 (CLAD) to 0.53 (LCM).

Conclusions
The LCM and TPM with a log-transformed dependent variable are superior to other approaches in handling data with ceiling effects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The long-term natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in terms of successive severe exacerbations and mortality is unknown.
METHODS: The authors formed an inception cohort of patients from their first ever hospitalisation for COPD during 1990-2005, using the healthcare databases from the province of Quebec, Canada. Patients were followed until death or 31 March 2007, and all COPD hospitalisations occurring during follow-up were identified. The hazard functions of successive hospitalised COPD exacerbations and all-cause mortality over time were estimated, and HRs adjusted for age, sex, calendar time and comorbidity.
RESULTS: The cohort included 73 106 patients hospitalised for the first time for COPD, of whom 50 580 died during the 17-year follow-up, with 50\% and 75\% mortality at 3.6 and 7.7 years respectively. The median time from the first to the second hospitalised exacerbation was around 5 years and decreased to {\textless}4 months from the 9th to the 10th. The risk of the subsequent severe exacerbation was increased threefold after the second severe exacerbation and 24-fold after the 10th, relative to the first. Mortality after a severe exacerbation peaked to 40 deaths per 10 000 per day in the first week after admission, dropping gradually to 5 after 3 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The course of COPD involves a rapid decline in health status after the second severe exacerbation and high mortality in the weeks following every severe exacerbation. Two strategic targets for COPD management should include delaying the second severe exacerbation and improving treatment of severe exacerbations to reduce their excessive early mortality.},

RESULTS: Based on the intensity of asthma drug therapy during the first year after entry into the cohort, 6661 patients (48.7\%) were initially prescribed therapy judged to be appropriate for mild asthma, and 977 (7.1\%) were dispensed medications in a manner suggesting their asthma was severe; the remaining 6033 (44.1\%) were classified as receiving treatment of intermediate intensity.

	volume = {21},

	abstract = {Although asthma is classically defined as reversible airflow obstruction, and often remits in younger subjects with milder disease, the natural history of asthma is that various degrees of airflow obstruction may persist and, in the long-term, asthma may become moderately to fully irreversible. Severe, irreversible airflow obstruction may develop despite apparently appropriate therapy and in the absence of other risk factors, such as smoking and environmental insults. All studies of subjects with persisting asthma show increased decline in lung function compared with normal subjects. Persistent abnormal physiology is reflected both in reduced airflow rates and in increased airway responsiveness. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of airway remodeling are described elsewhere in this issue. Questions not yet clearly answered are the reasons for these persistent abnormalities in some asthmatics, and which subjects are most at risk. Factors that adversely impact the outcome as adults identified relatively consistently among many longitudinal studies of the natural history of asthma include: Female gender. Environmental tobacco smoke exposure in childhood. Personal tobacco smoking in adolescence and adulthood. Age of onset of symptoms. Severity of childhood asthma. Duration of asthma. Severity of lung function abnormality in childhood. Bronchodilator reversibility. Degree of airway hyperresponsiveness. Delay in initiating anti-inflammatory therapy. Remission among adult asthmatics is uncommon, but is associated with better initial lung function, young age, male gender, and lesser degrees of airway responsiveness. The role of atopy remains controversial. Conversely, risk factors for death from asthma include older age, smoking, atopy, impaired lung function, and moderate to high reversibility. Treatment can improve lung function, reduce airway responsiveness, and improve quality of life. The overall effect of treatment on the natural history of the disease is not yet clear, despite significant short-term improvements from effective anti-inflammatory therapy.},

Assessments were performed at baseline, and at months 12 and 24. Monetary values were assigned to productivity loss and medical resource use. Direct and indirect costs were aggregated over 24 months and compared using Student's t-test for continuous measures and chi-squared for categorical variables.
RESULTS: Throughout the study, most patients had uncontrolled asthma (83\% uncontrolled; 16\% inconsistent control; 1.3\% controlled). Controlled patients experienced fewer work or school absences and less healthcare resource use than uncontrolled patients at all study time points. Using the multilevel ATAQ control score, asthma costs increased directly with the number of asthma control problems. Costs for uncontrolled patients were more than double those of controlled patients throughout the study (14,212 vs 6,452 US Dollars; adjusted to 2002 Dollars; P {\textless} 0.0001). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that few severe or difficult-to-treat asthma patients achieved control over a 2-year period and the economic consequence of uncontrolled disease is substantial.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Omalizumab, an anti-immunoglobulin E antibody, reduces exacerbations and symptoms in uncontrolled allergic asthma. The study objective was to estimate the costs and consequences of omalizumab compared to usual care from a US payer perspective.
METHODS: We estimated payer costs, quality-adjusted survival (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of omalizumab compared to usual care using a state-transition simulation model that included sensitivity analyses. Every 2 weeks, patients could transition between chronic asthma and exacerbation health states. The best available evidence informed the clinical and cost input estimates. Five years of omalizumab treatment followed by usual care was assumed to estimate a lifetime horizon. Omalizumab responders (60.5\% of treated) were modeled as a separate scenario where nonresponders reverted back to usual care after 16 weeks of active treatment.
RESULTS: The mean lifetime discounted costs and QALYs were \$83,400 and 13.87 for usual care and \$174,500 and 14.19 for omalizumab plus usual care resulting in \$287 200/QALY (95\% interval: \$219,300, \$557, 900). The ICER was \$172 300/QALY when comparing omalizumab to usual care in the responder scenario. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were sensitive to the difference in treatment-specific utilities for the chronic state, exacerbation-associated mortality, omalizumab price, exacerbation rates, and response definition.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that adding omalizumab to usual care improves QALYs at an increase in direct medical costs. The cost-effectiveness of omalizumab is similar to other chronic disease biologics. The value increases when omalizumab response is used to guide long-term treatment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with severe persistent asthma who are inadequately controlled despite treatment according to current asthma management guidelines have a significant unmet medical need. Such patients are at high risk of serious exacerbations and asthma-related mortality.
METHODS: Here, we pooled data from seven studies to determine the effect of omalizumab, an anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibody, on asthma exacerbations in patients with severe persistent asthma. Omalizumab was added to current asthma therapy and compared with placebo (in five double-blind studies) or with current asthma therapy alone (in two open-label studies). The studies included 4308 patients (2511 treated with omalizumab), 93\% of whom had severe persistent asthma according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2002 classification. Using the Poisson regression model, results were calculated as the ratio of treatment effect (omalizumab : control) on the standardized exacerbation rate per year.
RESULTS: Omalizumab significantly reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 38\% (P {\textless} 0.0001 vs control) and the rate of total emergency visits by 47\% (P {\textless} 0.0001 vs control). Analysis of demographic subgroups showed that the efficacy of omalizumab on asthma exacerbations was unaffected by patient age, gender, baseline serum IgE (split by median) or by 2- or 4-weekly dosing schedule, although benefit in absolute terms appeared to be greatest in patients with more severe asthma, defined by a lower value of percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that omalizumab may fulfil an important need in patients with severe persistent asthma, many of whom are not adequately controlled on current therapy.},

Objectives: This study was conducted to examine the safety and impact on lung function and airway responsiveness of BT over 2 yr.
Methods: The safety of BT was studied in 16 subjects with mild to moderate asthma. Baseline and 12-wk post-treatment measurements included spirometry, methacholine challenge, daily diary recordings of peak flow, symptoms, and medication usage. Subjects completed follow-up evaluations at 12 wk, 1 yr, and 2 yr.
Measurements and Main Results: The procedure was well tolerated; side effects were transient and typical of what is commonly observed after bronchoscopy. All subjects demonstrated improvement in airway responsiveness. The mean PC20 increased by 2.37 ± 1.72 (p {\textless} 0.001), 2.77 ± 1.53 (p = 0.007), and 2.64 ± 1.52 doublings (p {\textless} 0.001), at 12 wk, 1 yr, and 2 yr post-procedure, respectively. Data from daily diaries collected for 12 wk indicated significant improvements over baseline in symptom-free days (p = 0.015), morning peak flow (p = 0.01), and evening peak flow (p ⩽ 0.007). Spirometry measurements remained stable throughout the study period.
Conclusions: BT is well tolerated in patients with asthma and results in decreased airway hyperresponsiveness that persists for at least 2 yr.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bronchial thermoplasty is a bronchoscopic procedure to reduce the mass of airway smooth muscle and attenuate bronchoconstriction. We examined the effect of bronchial thermoplasty on the control of moderate or severe persistent asthma.
METHODS: We randomly assigned 112 subjects who had been treated with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA) and in whom asthma control was impaired when the LABA were withdrawn to either bronchial thermoplasty or a control group. The primary outcome was the frequency of mild exacerbations, calculated during three scheduled 2-week periods of abstinence from LABA at 3, 6, and 12 months. Airflow, airway responsiveness, asthma symptoms, the number of symptom-free days, use of rescue medication, and scores on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) and the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) were also assessed.
RESULTS: The mean rate of mild exacerbations, as compared with baseline, was reduced in the bronchial-thermoplasty group but was unchanged in the control group (change in frequency per subject per week, -0.16+/-0.37 vs. 0.04+/-0.29; P=0.005). At 12 months, there were significantly greater improvements in the bronchial-thermoplasty group than in the control group in the morning peak expiratory flow (39.3+/-48.7 vs. 8.5+/-44.2 liters per minute), scores on the AQLQ (1.3+/-1.0 vs. 0.6+/-1.1) and ACQ (reduction, 1.2+/-1.0 vs. 0.5+/-1.0), the percentage of symptom-free days (40.6+/-39.7 vs. 17.0+/-37.9), and symptom scores (reduction, 1.9+/-2.1 vs. 0.7+/-2.5) while fewer puffs of rescue medication were required. Values for airway responsiveness and forced expiratory volume in 1 second did not differ significantly between the two groups. Adverse events immediately after treatment were more common in the bronchial-thermoplasty group than in the control group but were similar during the period from 6 weeks to 12 months after treatment.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Inhaled Steroid as Regular Therapy in Early Asthma (START) study reported that early intervention with budesonide in mild persistent asthma reduces severe asthmatic events and improves symptom outcomes and lung function in adults and children.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of early intervention with budesonide, as observed within the START study.
METHODS: START was a randomized, 3-year controlled trial of budesonide in early onset mild asthma among 7165 subjects ages 5 to 66 years. Three age groups (5-10, 11-17, and {\textgreater}or=18 years) were studied separately and overall. Differences in the probability of emergency treatments, symptom-free days (SFDs), and costs of health care were determined. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated from the health care payer and societal perspectives.
RESULTS: Compared with usual therapy, patients receiving budesonide experienced an average of 14.1 (SE, 1.3) more SFDs per year (P {\textless}.001), fewer hospital days (69\%, P {\textless}.001), and fewer emergency department visits (67\%, P {\textless}.05). From the health care payer perspective, the net cost of early use of budesonide was an additional US dollars 0.42 (SE, dollars 0.04) per day, and the resultant cost-effectiveness ratio was US dollars 11.30 (95\% CI, US dollars 8.60-US dollars 14.90) per SFD gained. From the societal perspective, the cost offsets of lower absence from school or work reduced the net cost of early budesonide to US dollars 0.14 (SE, US dollars 0.07) per day and decreased the cost-effectiveness ratio to US dollars 3.70 (95\% CI, US dollars 0.10-US dollars 8.00). Early intervention was more effective and cost saving in the youngest age group.
CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment with budesonide appears to be cost-effective in patients with mild persistent asthma of recent onset.},

RESULTS: The annualized mean number of asthma deterioration-related incidents was reduced from 9.76 with BSC alone (n = 106) to 4.92 per patient-year with omalizumab (n = 206) (P {\textless} 0.001).

We determined the effect of omalizumab on clinically significant asthma exacerbations (requiring systemic corticosteroids) in the first omalizumab study to exclusively enrol patients from this difficult-to-treat patient population.
METHODS: Following a run-in phase, patients (12-75 years) inadequately controlled despite therapy with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABA) with reduced lung function and a recent history of clinically significant exacerbations were randomized to receive omalizumab or placebo for 28 weeks in a double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study.
RESULTS: A total of 419 patients were included in the efficacy analyses. The clinically significant asthma exacerbation rate (primary efficacy variable), adjusted for an observed relevant imbalance in history of clinically significant asthma exacerbations, was 0.68 with omalizumab and 0.91 with placebo (26\% reduction) during the 28-week treatment phase (P = 0.042). Without adjustment, a similar magnitude of effect was seen (19\% reduction), but this did not reach statistical significance. Omalizumab significantly reduced severe asthma exacerbation rate (0.24 vs 0.48, P = 0.002) and emergency visit rate (0.24 vs 0.43, P = 0.038). Omalizumab significantly improved asthma-related quality of life, morning peak expiratory flow and asthma symptom scores. The incidence of adverse events was similar between treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with inadequately controlled severe persistent asthma, despite high-dose ICS and LABA therapy, and often additional therapy, omalizumab significantly reduced the rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations, severe exacerbations and emergency visits. Omalizumab is effective and should be considered as add-on therapy for patients with inadequately controlled severe persistent asthma who have a significant unmet need despite best available therapy.},

OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of this procedure in subjects with symptomatic, severe asthma.
METHODS: Adults who were symptomatic despite treatment with fluticasone or equivalent at more than 750 mug/day, a long-acting beta(2)-agonist, and other medications, which could include 30 mg or less of oral prednisolone/day, were randomized to BT or to a control group. After treatment, subjects entered a 16-week steroid stable phase (Weeks 6-22), a 14-week steroid wean phase (Weeks 22-36), and a 16-week reduced steroid phase (Weeks 36-52).
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: BT resulted in a transient worsening of asthma symptoms. Seven hospitalizations for respiratory symptoms occurred in 4 of 15 BT subjects during the treatment period. Five hospitalizations were within 3 days of treatment. Two subjects had segmental collapse involving the most recently treated lobe; one required bronchoscopy and aspiration of a mucus plug. There were no hospitalizations during this period in the 17 control subjects. The rate of hospitalizations was similar in both groups in the post-treatment period. At 22 weeks, BT subjects had significant improvements versus control subjects in rescue medication use (-26.6 +/- 40.1 vs. -1.5 +/- 11.7 puffs/7 d, P {\textless} 0.05), prebronchodilator FEV(1)\% predicted (14.9 +/- 17.4 vs. -0.94 +/- 22.3\%, P = 0.04), and Asthma Control Questionnaire scores (-1.04 +/- 1.03 vs. -0.13 +/- 1.00, P = 0.02). Improvements in rescue medication use and Asthma Control Questionnaire scores remained significantly different from those of controls at 52 weeks.

Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of BT versus a sham procedure in subjects with severe asthma who remain symptomatic despite treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2-agonists.
Methods: A total of 288 adult subjects (Intent-to-Treat [ITT]) randomized to BT or sham control underwent three bronchoscopy procedures. Primary outcome was the difference in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) scores from baseline to average of 6, 9, and 12 months (integrated AQLQ). Adverse events and health care use were collected to assess safety. Statistical design and analysis of the primary endpoint was Bayesian. Target posterior probability of superiority (PPS) of BT over sham was 95\%, except for the primary endpoint (96.4\%).
Measurements and Main Results: The improvement from baseline in the integrated AQLQ score was superior in the BT group compared with sham (BT, 1.35 ± 1.10; sham, 1.16 ± 1.23 [PPS, 96.0\% ITT and 97.9\% per protocol]). Seventy-nine percent of BT and 64\% of sham subjects achieved changes in AQLQ of 0.5 or greater (PPS, 99.6\%). Six percent more BT subjects were hospitalized in the treatment period (up to 6 wk after BT). In the posttreatment period (6–52 wk after BT), the BT group experienced fewer severe exacerbations, emergency department (ED) visits, and days missed from work/school compared with the sham group (PPS, 95.5, 99.9, and 99.3\%, respectively).
Conclusions: BT in subjects with severe asthma improves asthma-specific quality of life with a reduction in severe exacerbations and healthcare use in the posttreatment period.

This study reports on some efforts to establish a “mapping” relationship between AQLQ (a non-preference-based QOL instrument for asthma) and EQ5D (a preference-based generic instrument). Various methods are described in terms of associated assumptions regarding the measurement properties of the instruments. This is followed by empirical mapping, based on regressing EQ5D on AQLQ. Six main regression models and two supplementary models are identified, and the regressions carried out. Performance of each model is explored in terms of goodness of fit between observed and predicted values, and of robustness of predictions on external data. The results show that it is possible to predict mean EQ5D indices given AQLQ data. The general implications for methods of mapping non-preference-based instruments onto preference-based measures are discussed.},

	abstract = {There has been a sharp increase in the global prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and economic burden associated with asthma over the last 40 years, particularly in children. Approximately 300 million people worldwide currently have asthma, and its prevalence increases by 50\% every decade. In North America, 10\% of the population have asthma. Asthma is underdiagnosed and undertreated, although the use of inhaled corticosteroids has made a positive impact on outcomes. The increasing number of hospital admissions for asthma, which are most pronounced in young children, reflect an increase in severe asthma, poor disease management, and poverty. Worldwide, approximately 180,000 deaths annually are attributable to asthma, although overall mortality rates have fallen since the 1980s. Most asthma deaths occur in those ≥ 45 years old and are largely preventable, frequently being related to inadequate long-term medical care or delays in obtaining medical help during the last attack. The financial burden on patients with asthma in different Western countries ranges from \$300 to \$1,300 per patient per year, disproportionately affecting those with the most severe disease. There are a number of significant barriers to reducing the burden of asthma, particularly in developing countries, where many patients have limited access to care and essential medications. The Global Initiative for Asthma has outlined a six-point patient management plan to address the effective handling of the increased number of patients in primary care. The plan focuses on patient education, written treatment plans, and ongoing communication and review with patients and their providers.},

Longitudinal cluster-based methods may provide novel insights in the study of natural history of asthma. Objectives: To compare the stability of cluster-based asthma phenotype structures a decade apart in adults and to address the individuals' phenotypic transition across these asthma phenotypes. Methods: The Latent Transition Analysis (LTA) was applied on longitudinal data (twice 10 years apart) from 3320 adults with asthma who took part in ECRHS (European Community Respiratory Health Survey), SAPALDIA (Swiss cohort study on air pollution and lung disease) or EGEA (Epidemiological study on Genetics and Environment of Asthma). Nine variables covering personal and phenotypic characteristics measured twice 10 years apart were simultaneously considered. Main Results: LTA identifies 7 asthma phenotypes (prevalence range: 8.4\% to 20.8\%), mainly characterized by the level of asthma symptoms (low, moderate, high), the allergic status and pulmonary function. Phenotypes observed 10 years apart showed strong similarities. The probability of membership in the same asthma phenotype at both times varied across phenotypes from 54\% to 88\%. Different transition patterns were observed across phenotypes. Transitions towards increased asthma symptoms were more frequently observed among non-allergic phenotypes as compared to allergic phenotypes. Results showed a strong stability of the allergic status over time. Conclusion: Adult asthma phenotypes identified by a clustering approach, 10 years apart, were highly consistent. This study is the first to model the probabilities of transitioning over time between comprehensive asthma phenotypes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The long-term natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in terms of successive severe exacerbations and mortality is unknown.
METHODS: The authors formed an inception cohort of patients from their first ever hospitalisation for COPD during 1990-2005, using the healthcare databases from the province of Quebec, Canada. Patients were followed until death or 31 March 2007, and all COPD hospitalisations occurring during follow-up were identified. The hazard functions of successive hospitalised COPD exacerbations and all-cause mortality over time were estimated, and HRs adjusted for age, sex, calendar time and comorbidity.
RESULTS: The cohort included 73 106 patients hospitalised for the first time for COPD, of whom 50 580 died during the 17-year follow-up, with 50\% and 75\% mortality at 3.6 and 7.7 years respectively. The median time from the first to the second hospitalised exacerbation was around 5 years and decreased to {\textless}4 months from the 9th to the 10th. The risk of the subsequent severe exacerbation was increased threefold after the second severe exacerbation and 24-fold after the 10th, relative to the first. Mortality after a severe exacerbation peaked to 40 deaths per 10 000 per day in the first week after admission, dropping gradually to 5 after 3 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The course of COPD involves a rapid decline in health status after the second severe exacerbation and high mortality in the weeks following every severe exacerbation. Two strategic targets for COPD management should include delaying the second severe exacerbation and improving treatment of severe exacerbations to reduce their excessive early mortality.},

	abstract = {Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine are medications used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These agents have been shown to reduce the rate of AD progression in randomized trials. The objective of this study is to evaluate the association between treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine and the probability of transitioning to a more severe Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) state. Analysis was limited to possible or probable AD patients from NACC-UDS with three or more observations, baseline CDR score of 0.5 or 1, and without reported use AD drugs at enrollment. Use of an AD drug at any observation after baseline was classified as treatment. Odds of CDR stage were calculated by multinomial logistic regression controlling for baseline age, baseline MMSE score, education, marital status, race, gender, place of residence, and time since last measure. The resulting coefficients from logistic regression were used to calculate transitional probabilities. A total of 1,114 patients were included. No differences were observed in the probability of transitioning to more severe CDR states based on treatment, but treated patients had lower odds of death, OR 0.49 (95\% CI 0.31 to 0.79) compared to untreated. Ultimately, this study failed to detect a difference in the probability of progressing to a more severe AD state as a result of treatment in an observational cohort of AD patients, but is limited by non-randomized treatment selection and small dataset. The NACC-UDS dataset is ongoing and this analysis may be improved if repeated when more data is available.},

OBJECTIVE: This retrospective analysis of 5 budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy (Symbicort SMART Turbuhaler(*)) studies assessed the relationship between asthma control questionnaire (ACQ-5) and Global Initiative for Asthma-defined clinical asthma control and future risk of instability and exacerbations.
METHODS: The percentage of patients with Global Initiative for Asthma-defined controlled asthma over time was assessed for budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy versus the 3 maintenance therapies; higher dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), same dose ICS/long-acting beta(2)-agonist (LABA), and higher dose ICS/LABA plus short-acting beta(2)-agonist. The relationship between baseline ACQ-5 and exacerbations was investigated. A Markov analysis examined the transitional probability of change in control status throughout the studies.
RESULTS: The percentage of patients achieving asthma control increased with time, irrespective of treatment; the percentage Controlled/Partly Controlled at study end was at least similar to budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy versus the 3 maintenance therapies: higher dose ICS (56\% vs 45\%), same dose ICS/LABA (56\% vs 53\%), and higher dose ICS/LABA (54\% vs 54\%). Baseline ACQ-5 score correlated positively with exacerbation rates. A Controlled or Partly Controlled week predicted at least Partly Controlled asthma the following week ({\textgreater}or=80\% probability). The better the control, the lower the risk of an Uncontrolled week. The probability of an exacerbation was related to current state and was lower with budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Current control predicts future risk of instability and exacerbations. Budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy reduces exacerbations versus comparators and achieves at least similar control.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We describe the intensity of therapy for patients with newly diagnosed asthma and how it changed during subsequent years in relation to age, sex, and initial level of therapy.
METHODS: We examined a cohort of 13,671 patients in Saskatchewan, Canada, who were initially between the ages of 5 and 44 years. Patients were followed prospectively, and the intensity of asthma therapy was measured during successive 12-month periods.
RESULTS: Based on the intensity of asthma drug therapy during the first year after entry into the cohort, 6661 patients (48.7\%) were initially prescribed therapy judged to be appropriate for mild asthma, and 977 (7.1\%) were dispensed medications in a manner suggesting their asthma was severe; the remaining 6033 (44.1\%) were classified as receiving treatment of intermediate intensity. Among patients initially classified as receiving treatment appropriate for mild disease, only about 3\% were dispensed medications that suggested that their asthma had become severe during up to 5 years of follow-up. Intensity of therapy waned in a substantial proportion of patients who were initially classified as having severe asthma, especially if they were initially younger than 15 years of age. Thirty-four per 100 patients initially younger than 15 years old were receiving medications appropriate for mild asthma, and 23 per 100 such patients received no medication for asthma during a 12-month period when followed up to 5 years.
CONCLUSION: Patients with asthma who are initially treated with therapy appropriate for mild asthma are rarely treated later with therapy suggesting the advent of severe disease. Patients initially dispensed medications suggesting the presence of severe asthma often see the intensity of treatment wane over time.},

	abstract = {In a randomized clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of different strategies for treating low-back pain in a managed-care setting, 681 adult patients presenting with low-back pain were randomized to four treatment groups: medical care with and without physical therapy; and chiropractic care with and without physical modalities. Follow-up information was obtained by questionnaires at two and six weeks, six, 12 and 18 months and by a telephone interview at four weeks. One outcome measurement at each follow-up is the patient's self-report on the perception of low-back pain improvement from the previous survey, recorded as 'A lot better,' 'A little better,' 'About the same' and 'Worse.' Since the patient's perception of improvement may be influenced by past experience, the outcome is analysed using a transition (first-order Markov) model. Although one could collapse categories to the point that logistic regression analysis with repeated measurements could be used, here we allow for multiple categories by relating transition probabilities to covariates and previous outcomes through a polytomous logistic regression model with Markov structure. This approach allows us to assess not only the effects of treatment assignment and baseline characteristics but also the effects of past outcomes in analysing longitudinal categorical data.},

	abstract = {At present, asthma represents a substantial burden on health care resources in all countries so far studied. The costs of asthma are largely due to uncontrolled disease, and are likely to rise as its prevalence and severity increase. Costs could be significantly reduced if disease control is improved. A large proportion of the total cost of illness is derived from treating the consequences of poor asthma control-direct costs, such as emergency room use and hospitalizations. Indirect costs, which include time off work or school and early retirement, are incurred when the disease is not fully controlled and becomes severe enough to have an effect on daily life. In addition, quality of life assessments show that asthma has a significant socioeconomic impact, not only on the patients themselves, but on the whole family. Underuse of prescribed therapy, which includes poor compliance, significantly contributes towards the poor control of asthma. The consequences of poor compliance in asthma include increased morbidity and sometimes mortality, and increased health care expenditure. To improve asthma management, international guidelines have been introduced which recommend an increase in the use of prophylactic therapy. The resulting improvements in the control of asthma will reduce the number of hospitalizations associated with asthma, and may ultimately produce a shift within direct costs, with subsequent reductions in indirect costs. In addition, costs may be reduced by improving therapeutic interventions and through effective patient education programmes. This paper reviews current literature on the costs of asthma to assess how effectively money is spent and, by estimating the proportion of the cost attributable to uncontrolled disease, will identify where financial savings might be made.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To estimate the direct and indirect costs of severe asthma and the economic impact of its management to low-income families in Salvador, Brazil.
METHODS: One hundred and ninety-seven patients with severe asthma and referred to a state-funded asthma center providing free treatment were evaluated. At registration, they were asked about family cost-events in the previous year and had a baseline assessment of lung function, symptoms and quality of life. During the subsequent year, they were reassessed prospectively.
RESULTS: One hundred-eighty patients concluded a 12-month follow-up. Eighty-four percent were female patients, and the median family income was US\$ 2955/year. Forty-seven percent of family members had lost their jobs because of asthma. Total cost of asthma management took 29\% of family income. After proper treatment, asthma control scores improved by 50\% and quality of life by 74\%. The income of the families increased by US\$ 711/year, as their members went back to work. The total cost of asthma to the families was reduced by a median US\$ 789/family/year. Consequently, an annual surplus of US\$ 1500/family became available.
CONCLUSIONS: Family costs of severe asthma consumed over one-fourth of the family income of the underprivileged population in a middle-income country. Adequate management brings major economic benefit to individuals and families.},

	abstract = {Data collected from the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) in 1994/95 and 1996/97 were used to measure longitudinal health outcomes among children with asthma. Over 10 000 children aged 1 to 11 years with complete data on asthma status in both years were included. Outcomes included hospitalizations and health services use (HSU). Current asthma was defined as children diagnosed with asthma by a physician and who took prescribed inhalants regularly, had wheezing or an attack in the previous year, or had their activities limited by asthma. Children having asthma significantly increased their odds of hospitalization (OR = 2.52; 95\% CI: 1.71, 3.70) and health services use (OR = 3.80; 95\% CI: 2.69, 5.37). Low-income adequacy (LIA) in 1994/ 95 significantly predicts hospitalization and HSU in 1996/97 (OR = 2.68; 95\% CI: 1.29, 5.59 and OR = 0.67; 95\% CI: 0.45, 0.99, respectively). Our results confirmed that both having current asthma and living in low-income families had a significant impact on the health status of children in Canada. Programs seeking to decrease the economic burden of pediatric hospitalizations need to focus on asthma and low-income populations.},

This review, arising from the work of an American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society Task Force, identifies the need for separate concepts of control and severity, describes their evolution in asthma guidelines and provides a framework for understanding the relationship between current concepts of asthma phenotype, severity and control. "Asthma control" refers to the extent to which the manifestations of asthma have been reduced or removed by treatment. Its assessment should incorporate the dual components of current clinical control (e.g. symptoms, reliever use and lung function) and future risk (e.g. exacerbations and lung function decline). The most clinically useful concept of asthma severity is based on the intensity of treatment required to achieve good asthma control, i.e. severity is assessed during treatment. Severe asthma is defined as the requirement for (not necessarily just prescription or use of) high-intensity treatment. Asthma severity may be influenced by the underlying disease activity and by the patient's phenotype, both of which may be further described using pathological and physiological markers. These markers can also act as surrogate measures for future risk.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate whether the socioeconomic status of children and adolescents with asthma is associated with optimal use of asthma medications in a health care system that provides free access to prescribed medications.
METHODS: A cohort of 29,018 children (5-12 y) and adolescents (13-17 y) with asthma was reconstructed from the administrative health database of the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec in Canada. Adherence to the Canadian Asthma Guidelines was compared between low-income patients (patients living in families receiving social assistance) and higher-income patients (patients living in middle-class families with working parents). Both groups of patients had free, universal access to medical care and prescribed medications. Patients were considered adherent if they had: (1) 10 doses or fewer of a short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) per week or (2) greater than 10 doses of a SABA per week plus greater than 1,000 microg of beclomethasone chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) per day. A second definition of adherence was used in which the 10 doses of SABA were replaced by 3 doses.
RESULTS: Our cohort comprised 7,454 adolescents and 21,564 children. Within each definition, low-income adolescents had similar rates of adherence as higher-income adolescents (p = .08-.4). Low-income children, however, had lower rates of adherence than higher-income children when the first definition of adherence was used (76\% vs. 80\%; p {\textless} .001).
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that socioeconomic status had a small influence on the likelihood of receiving treatment in adherence with the Canadian Asthma Guidelines among children, whereas no association was detected among adolescents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown differences in adherence to inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) by race-ethnicity, yet little is known about factors that contribute to adherence within these groups. Environmental stressors, such as crime exposure, which has been associated with asthma morbidity, might also predict ICS adherence.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify factors associated with ICS adherence among patients with asthma and among African American patients and white patients separately.
METHODS: Study patients with asthma were aged 18 to 50 years and were enrolled in a large southeast Michigan health maintenance organization between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2001. The primary outcome, ICS adherence, was calculated by linking prescription-fill data with dosage information. Predictor variables included age, sex, race-ethnicity, measures of socioeconomic status (SES), average ICS copay, existing comorbidities, and crime rate in area of residence.
RESULTS: Adherence information was available for 176 patients. ICS adherence was lower among African American patients (n = 75) when compared with white patients (n = 94; 40\% vs 58\%, respectively; P = .002). Among white patients, adherence was significantly lower for women when compared with men. Among African American patients, age and residential crime rates were positively and negatively associated with ICS adherence, respectively. Area crime remained a predictor of adherence in African American patients, even after adjusting for multiple measures of SES.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that an environmental stressor, area crime, provides additional predictive insight into ICS-adherent behavior beyond typical SES factors.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Better understanding of environmental factors that influence ICS adherence might aid in efforts to improve it.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE Individuals of lower socioeconomic status have higher rates of hospitalization due to ambulatory care–sensitive conditions, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. We examined whether differences in patient demographics, ambulatory care use, or physician characteristics could explain this disparity in avoidable hospitalizations.
METHODS Using administrative data from the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, we identified all adults aged 18 to 70 years with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, grouped together as obstructive airway disease. We divided patients into census-derived income quintiles using average household income. We performed a series of multivariate logistic regression analyses to determine how the association of socioeconomic status with the risk of obstructive airway disease–related hospitalizations changed after controlling for blocks of covariates related to patient demographics (socioeconomic status, age, sex, and comorbidity), ambulatory care use (continuity influenza vaccination and specialist referral), and characteristics of the patient’s usual physician (eg, payment mechanism, sex, years in practice).
RESULTS We included 34,741 patients with obstructive airway disease, 729 (2.1\%) of whom were hospitalized with a related diagnosis during a 2-year period. Patients having a lower income were more likely to be hospitalized than peers having the highest income, and this effect of socioeconomic status remained virtually unchanged after controlling for every other variable studied. In a fully adjusted model, patients in the lowest income quintile had approximately 3 times the odds of hospitalization relative to counterparts in the highest income quintile (odds ratio = 2.93; 95\% confidence limits: 2.19, 3.93).
CONCLUSIONS In the setting of universal health care, the income-based disparity in hospitalizations for respiratory ambulatory care–sensitive conditions cannot be explained by factors directly related to the use of ambulatory services that can be measured using administrative data. Our findings suggest that we look beyond the health care system at the broader social determinants of health to reduce the number of avoidable hospitalizations among the poor.},

METHODS: The Canadian Community Health Survey was linked to hospital, physician and medication data in Saskatoon.
RESULTS: Of 3,688 eligible participants, 3,433 agreed to the health survey and data linkage with health records (83.7\% overall response). Low-income residents were 27-33\% more likely to be hospitalized and 36-45\% more likely to receive a medication than middle- and higher-income residents, but were 5-7\% less likely to visit a physician over a one-year period. In comparison to middle-income residents, low-income residents had 56\% more high users of hospitals, 166\% more high users of physicians and 90\% more high users of medications. Low-income residents had 34-35\% higher health care costs overall than middle- and high-income residents. After multivariate adjustment for increased disease prevalence, low income had a reduced association with high health care utilization.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that residents with lower income are responsible for disproportionate usage of hospitals, physicians and medications; due mainly (but not entirely) to higher disease prevalence.},

	abstract = {Asthma prevalence is increasing and asthma-related costs are likely to increase, but few studies have analysed the relationship of asthma costs and severity. The impact of severity on costs was quantified in a cohort of 318 asthmatic patients followed up prospectively for 1 yr. Patients presenting with a broad range of severity of the disease (intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, severe persistent) were recruited by chest physicians throughout France and treated for 1 yr according to customary clinical practice and following international guidelines. Severity, direct and indirect costs, and quality of life (QoL) were assessed. A multivariate analysis was conducted to relate factors contributing to the costs measured. Mean direct costs for goods and services excluding hospitalization, numbers of consultations, supplementary examinations, and the use and cost of bronchodilators and corticosteroids, indirect costs of days lost from work, and adverse QoL parameters all increased significantly with increasing severity. This also applied to mean age, body weight, asthma duration, depression of forced expiratory volume in one second, and inhaled corticosteroid posology in the 234 patients completing the study. There was a significant relationship (r=0.614, p{\textless}0.001) between direct costs (hospitalization and cures were excluded) and three domains of the QoL questionnaire (mobility, pain and energy). Overall costs of asthma (including individual direct costs, indirect costs, and intangible quality of life costs) are clearly related to severity. This is the first study in asthma to combine rigorous independent classification of grades of severity in statistically valid numbers of patients of grades receiving "real-world" treatment and followed-up prospectively for 1 yr. It allowed severity to be accurately related to direct, indirect and intangible costs of asthma. Quality of life explained a significant part of these costs.},

Little information is available relating to the costs of asthma depending on the degree of severity of the disease. Total, direct and indirect costs generated by asthma patients who sought medical care for asthma control over a one-year period in a northern area of Spain were determined. Data were obtained from the patients themselves and severity of illness was classified into mild, moderate and severe according to the International Consensus Report on Diagnosis and Treatment of Asthma, 1992. The average total annual asthma-derived cost was estimated at US\$2,879 per patient, with averages of US\$1,336 in mildly asthmatic patients, US\$2,407 in moderate asthma and US\$6,393 in severe asthma. At all levels of severity, indirect costs were twice as high as direct costs, and at the same degree of severity, direct costs due to medication and hospitalization were higher among females than males. A minority of severe asthmatics incurred some 41\% of the total costs. The cost of asthma was surprisingly high and varied substantially depending on the degree of severity of the disease. Further knowledge of the costs of asthma across various levels of severity will contribute to a better characterization of optimal intervention strategies for asthma care.},

Understanding ethnic differences in health status (HS) could help to design culturally-appropriate interventions. We hypothesized that there are race/ethnic differences in HS between non-Hispanic whites and Mexican-Americans with obstructive lung disease (OLD), and that they are mediated by socioeconomic factors.Methods:
We analyzed 826 U.S. adults 30 years of age and older self-identified as Mexican-Americans or non-Hispanic whites with spirometry-confirmed OLD (FEV1/FVC {\textless}0.7) who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2010. We assessed associations between Mexican-American ethnicity and self-reported HS using logistic regression models adjusted for demographics, smoking status, number of comorbidities, limitation for work, and lung function, and tested the contribution of education and healthcare access to ethnic differences in HS.Results:
Among Mexican-American with OLD, worse (fair/poor) health status was more prevalent than among non-Hispanic Whites (weighted \% [standard error], 46.6\% [5.0] vs. 15.2\% [1.6]; P{\textless}0.001). In bivariate analysis socioeconomic characteristics were associated with lower odds of reporting poor HS (high school graduation OR 0.24, 95\%, CI 0.10-0.40; access to healthcare OR 0.50, 95\% CI 0.30-0.80). In fully-adjusted models there was a strong association between Mexican-American ethnicity (vs. non-Hispanic white) and fair/poor HS (odds ratio [OR], 7.52 [95\% CI, (4.43 – 12.78)]; P{\textless}0.001). Higher education and access to healthcare contributed to lower the Mexican-American ethnicity odds of fair/poor HS by 47\% and 16\%, respectively; and together they contributed 55\% to reduce the differences in HS with non-Hispanic Whites.Conclusion:
Mexican-Americans with OLD report poorer overall health status than non-Hispanic whites, and education and healthcare access are large contributors to the difference.},

The aim of this systematic review is to clarify associations between SEP and the prevalence of asthma and allergies. Out of 4407 records identified, 183 were included in the analysis. Low SEP was associated with a higher prevalence of asthma in 63\% of the studies. Research on allergies, however, showed a positive association between higher SEP and illness in 66\% of studies. Pooled estimates for the odds ratio of disease for the highest compared with the lowest SEP confirmed these results for asthma (unadjusted OR 1.38, 95\% CI 1.37–1.39), allergies in general (OR 0.67, 95\% CI 0.62–0.72), atopic dermatitis (unadjusted OR 0.72, 95\% CI 0.61–0.83) and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (unadjusted OR 0.52, 95\% CI 0.46–0.59). Sensitivity analyses with a subsample of high-quality studies led to the same conclusion. Evidence from this systematic review suggests that asthma is associated with lower SEP, whereas the prevalence of allergies is associated with higher SEP.

Beta-blockers have been proved to reduce morbidity and improve survival in patients with cardiac diseases. But the effects of beta-blockers on outcomes in patients with COPD remain controversial. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the effect of beta-blockers on mortality and exacerbation in patients with COPD. Methods An extensive search of the EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane was performed to retrieve the studies of beta-blockers treatment in patients with COPD. The random effects model meta-analysis was used to evaluate effect on overall mortality and exacerbation of COPD. Results Fifteen original observational cohort studies with a follow-up time from 1 to 7.2 years were included. The results revealed that beta-blockers treatment significantly decreased the risk of overall mortality and exacerbation of COPD. The relative risk (RR) for overall mortality was 0.72 (0.63 to 0.83), and for exacerbation of COPD was 0.63 (0.57 to 0.71). In subgroup analysis of COPD patients with coronary heart disease or heart failure, the risk for overall mortality was 0.64 (0.54–0.76) and 0.74 (0.58–0.93), respectively. Conclusion The findings of this meta-analysis confirmed that beta-blocker use in patients with COPD may not only decrease the risk of overall mortality but also reduce the risk of exacerbation of COPD. Beta-blocker prescription for cardiovascular diseases needs to improve in COPD patients.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine if statins (hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors [HMG-CoA]), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce cardiovascular (CV) events and pulmonary morbidity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
BACKGROUND: Few current COPD therapies alter prognosis. Although statins, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs improve outcomes in CV populations, their benefits in COPD patients both with and without concomitant heart disease has not previously been studied.
METHODS: A time-matched nested case-control study of two population-based retrospective cohorts was undertaken: 1) COPD patients having undergone coronary revascularization (high CV risk cohort); and 2) COPD patients without previous myocardial infarction (MI) and newly treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (low CV risk cohort). Prespecified outcomes were COPD hospitalization, MI, and total mortality.
RESULTS: These drugs reduced both CV and pulmonary outcomes, with the largest benefits occurring with the combination of statins and either ACE inhibitors or ARBs. This combination was associated with a reduction in COPD hospitalization (risk ratio [RR] 0.66, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.51 to 0.85) and total mortality (RR 0.42, 95\% CI 0.33 to 0.52) not only in the high CV risk cohort but also in the low CV risk cohort (RR 0.77, 95\% CI 0.67 to 0.87, and RR 0.36, 95\% CI 0.28 to 0.45, respectively). The combination also reduced MI in the high CV risk cohort (RR 0.39, 95\% CI 0.31 to 0.49). Benefits were similar when steroid users were included.
CONCLUSIONS: These agents may have dual cardiopulmonary protective properties, thereby substantially altering prognosis of patients with COPD. These findings need confirmation in randomized clinical trials.},

However, it is not clear whether this is due to shared risk factors or if COPD increases the risk for CVD independently. This study aimed to provide a systematic review of studies that investigated the association between COPD and CVD outcomes, assessing any effect of confounding by common risk factors.
METHODS: A search was conducted in MEDLINE (via PubMed) for observational studies published between January 1990 and March 2012 reporting cardiovascular comorbidity in patients with COPD (or vice versa).
RESULTS: Of the 7,322 citations identified, 25 studies were relevant for this systematic review. Twenty-two studies provided an estimate for CVD risk in COPD, whereas four studies provided estimates of COPD risk in CVD. The crude prevalence for the aggregate CVD category ranged from 28\% to 70\%, likely due to differences in populations studied and CVD definitions; unadjusted rate ratio (RR) estimates of unspecified CVD among patients with COPD compared with patients without COPD ranged from 2.1 to 5.0. The association between COPD and CVD persisted after adjustment for shared risk factors in the majority of the studies. Two studies found a relationship between the severity of airflow limitation and CVD risk. Increased RRs were observed for individual CVD types, but their estimates varied considerably for congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, arrhythmias, stroke, arterial hypertension, and peripheral arterial disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Available observational data support the hypothesis that COPD is associated with an increased risk of CVD.},

Under these circumstances, it is helpful to assess the robustness of a statistical inference to the inclusion of a potentially confounding variable. In this article, an index is derived for quantifying the impact of a confounding variable on the inference of a regression coefficient. The index is developed for the bivariate case and then generalized to the multivariate case, and the distribution of the index is discussed. The index also is compared with existing indexes and procedures. An example is presented for the relationship between socioeconomic background and educational attainment, and a reference distribution for the index is obtained.

	abstract = {Increasing evidence indicates that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease involving more than airflow obstruction. Airflow obstruction has profound effects on cardiac function and gas exchange with systemic consequences. In addition, as COPD results from inflammation and/or alterations in repair mechanisms, the “spill-over” of inflammatory mediators into the circulation may result in important systemic manifestations of the disease, such as skeletal muscle wasting and cachexia. Systemic inflammation may also initiate or worsen comorbid diseases, such as ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, osteoporosis, normocytic anaemia, lung cancer, depression and diabetes. Comorbid diseases potentiate the morbidity of COPD, leading to increased hospitalisations, mortality and healthcare costs. Comorbidities complicate the management of COPD and need to be evaluated carefully. Current therapies for comorbid diseases, such as statins and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-agonists, may provide unexpected benefits for COPD patients. Treatment of COPD inflammation may concomitantly treat systemic inflammation and associated comorbidities. However, new broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory treatments, such as phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, have significant side-effects so it may be necessary to develop inhaled drugs in the future. Another approach is the reversal of corticosteroid resistance, for example with effective antioxidants. More research is needed on COPD comorbidities and their treatment.},

RESULTS: Studies that reported psychometric properties supported the construct validity, test-retest reliability, and responsiveness of EQ-5D in asthma (seven studies) and COPD (nine studies), although some evidence of ceiling effects were observed in asthma studies. In asthma studies that reported summary scores (n=11), EQ-5D index-based scores ranged from 0.42 (SD 0.30) to 0.93 (SD not reported). In COPD studies (n=8), scores ranged from 0.52 (SD 0.16) to 0.84 (SD 0.15). While few asthma studies reported scores by severity level, sufficient studies in COPD were available to calculate pooled mean utility scores according to GOLD stage: stage I=0.74 (0.62-0.87), stage II=0.74 (0.66-0.83), stage III=0.69 (0.60-0.78) and stage IV=0.61 (0.44-0.77) (most severe).
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence generally supported the validity and reliability of EQ-5D in asthma and COPD. Utility scores associated with COPD stage may be useful for modeling health outcomes in economic evaluations of treatments for COPD.},

Rasch models were applied to samples of responders to the AQLQ with the aim of selecting a number of items for a preference-based utility measure (AQL-5D). Selection of items for the evaluation survey was supported with classical psychometric criteria for item selection (feasibility, internal consistency, floor and ceiling effects, and responsiveness). Rasch analysis proved to be a useful tool in assisting in the initial process of selecting items from an existing health-related quality-of-life instrument in the construction of the AQL-5D.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Five health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) indexes--EQ-5D, HUI2, HUI3, QWB-SA, and SF-6D--are each used to assign community-based utility scores to health states, although these scores differ.
OBJECTIVE: The authors transform these indexes to a common scale to understand their interrelationships.
METHODS: Data were from the National Health Measurement Study, a telephone survey of 3844 US adults. The 5 indexes were analyzed using item response theory analysis to estimate scores on an underlying construct of summary health, theta. Unidimensionality was evaluated using nonlinear principal components analysis. Index scores were plotted against the estimated scores on the common underlying construct. In addition, scores on the Health and Activities Limitation Index (HALex), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Healthy Days questions, and self-rated health on a 5-category scale ranging from excellent to poor were plotted.
RESULTS: SF-6D and QWB-SA are nearly linear across the range of but with a shallow slope; EQ-5D, HUI2, and HUI3 are linear with a steep slope from low (poor health) into midrange of , then approximately linear with a less steep slope for higher (health just below to well above average), although the inflection points differ by index.
CONCLUSION: Simple linear functions may serve as crosswalks among these indexes only for lower health states, albeit with low precision. Ceiling effects make crosswalks among most of the indexes ill specified above a certain level of health. Although each index measures generic health on a utility scale, these indexes are not identical but are relatively simply, if imprecisely, related.},

Strong, linear associations were found between the number of chronic diseases and depressive symptoms and anxiety, indicating that psychological distress among elderly people is more apparent in the presence of (more) diseases. Furthermore, in contrast to general assumptions that mastery is a relatively stable state, our results indicate that mastery is affected by having chronic diseases. The 8 groups of chronically ill patients (with cardiac disease, peripheral atherosclerosis, stroke, diabetes, lung disease, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or cancer) did differ in their associations with psychological distress. Psychological distress is most frequently experienced by patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and stroke, whereas diabetic and cardiac patients appear to be the least psychologically distressed. Differences in disease characteristics, such as functional incapacitation and illness controllability, may partly explain these observed psychological differences across diseases.},

The question of whose values are used in cost-effectiveness analysis is ultimately a normative one, but the decision should be informed by evidence on the reasons for the differences. There is a case for obtaining better informed general population preferences by providing more information on what it is like for patients (including the process of adaptation).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The SF-6D and EQ-5D are both preference-based measures of health. Empirical work is required to determine what the smallest change is in utility scores that can be regarded as important and whether this change in utility value is constant across measures and conditions.
OBJECTIVES: To use distribution and anchor-based methods to determine and compare the minimally important difference (MID) for the SF-6D and EQ-5D for various datasets.
METHODS: The SF-6D is scored on a 0.29-1.00 scale and the EQ-5D on a -0.59-1.00 scale, with a score of 1.00 on both, indicating 'full health'. Patients were followed for a period of time, then asked, using question 2 of the SF-36 as our anchor, if their general health is much better (5), somewhat better (4), stayed the same (3), somewhat worse (2) or much worse (1) compared to the last time they were assessed. We considered patients whose global rating score was 4 or 2 as having experienced some change equivalent to the MID. This paper describes and compares the MID and standardised response mean (SRM) for the SF-6D and EQ-5D from eight longitudinal studies in 11 patient groups that used both instruments.
RESULTS: From the 11 reviewed studies, the MID for the SF-6D ranged from 0.011 to 0.097, mean 0.041. The corresponding SRMs ranged from 0.12 to 0.87, mean 0.39 and were mainly in the 'small to moderate' range using Cohen's criteria, supporting the MID results. The mean MID for the EQ-5D was 0.074 (range -0.011-0.140) and the SRMs ranged from -0.05 to 0.43, mean 0.24. The mean MID for the EQ-SD was almost double that of the mean MID for the SF-6D.
CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that the MID for these two utility measures are not equal and differ in absolute values. The EQ-5D scale has approximately twice the range of the SF-6D scale. Therefore, the estimates of the MID for each scale appear to be proportionally equivalent in the context of the range of utility scores for each scale. Further empirical work is required to see whether or not this holds true for other utility measures, patient groups and populations.},

Both generic and disease-specific measures are frequently used to assess health-related quality of life (QOL). The present study assessed the effects of comorbidity on the results of QOL measures through an analysis of longitudinal data from 3 double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials dealing with heartburn, asthma, and ulcer. Patients were assigned to subgroups by comorbidity status: those with no comorbid diseases and those whose principal disease was heartburn, asthma, or ulcer and whose comorbid condition was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or chronic bronchitis; hypertension; migraine, coronary artery disease, or varicose veins; chronic gastrointestinal conditions; arthritis or back pain; diabetes; or depression. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to test the study hypotheses. The study results suggest that comorbid conditions significantly and extensively affect patients' scores on generic QOL measures and estimation of treatment effect, whereas their influence on disease-specific QOL scores and estimation of treatment effect is considerably smaller. Further, the most important comorbidities in the 3 trial populations were arthritis or back pain and depression, which respectively accounted for 17\% and 5\% of the patient population. These findings have significant practical implications for the estimation of true treatment effects, control of comorbidity effects, and design of QOL trials.},

OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare, in a unified framework, adherence, outcomes, and costs associated with ICS+LTRA versus ICS+LABA as step-up therapies for asthma.
METHODS: Using the administrative databases of British Columbia, Canada (years 1997-2007), we created a propensity score-matched sample of asthmatic patients (12-45 years old) receiving ICS+LTRA therapy versus ICS+LABA therapy after a period of monotherapy with an ICS. We compared the outcomes using 2 analyses: an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis that followed subjects for a fixed period of 2 years and an uninterrupted treatment analysis that followed subjects for as long as they continuously dispensed their index medications.
RESULTS: The matched cohort consisted of 1032 subjects in each group (mean age at entry, 27.4 years; 52.5\% female). Adherence, which was defined as the proportion of days covered, was higher in the ICS+LABA group compared with the ICS+LTRA group. In both the ITT and uninterrupted treatment analyses, use of ICS+LTRA therapy was associated with more asthma-related outpatient visits, asthma-related medication dispensations, and dispensation of reliever medications. Dispensation of oral corticosteroids and rate of asthma exacerbations were higher in the ICS+LTRA group in the uninterrupted treatment analysis but not in the ITT analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world clinical setting subjects were more adherent to ICS+LABA therapy than ICS+LTRA therapy. ICS+LABA therapy seems to be more effective than ICS+LTRA therapy in the management of asthma, regardless of adherence.},

A standardized methodology for measuring resource consumption is critical to funding and resource allocation both at a global and organizational level. This study was undertaken to determine whether or not the Canadian system for measuring resource consumption, Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) RIWs, was reflective of the relative cost differences between inpatient cases at the Greater Victoria Hospital Society (GVHS) and to identify RIWs with a significant difference in comparison to GVHS cost weights. A regression analysis was performed on the more than 30,000 inpatient cost profile records from the GVHS 1995-96 cost and patient activity data. The scope of the analysis was restricted to the 424 Case Mix Groups (CMGs) that had a minimum composition of five patient profiles. Comparisons of GVHS cost weights to CIHI RIWs yielded mostly positive results. With the noted exception of about 20 CMGs, there was a high correlation between the CIHI RIW and the GVHS actual cost weights. Hence, the GVHS cost weights can be viewed with confidence as representative of the relative cost differences between typical RIW value CMGs and actual costs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Past studies of the prevalence of childhood asthma have yielded conflicting findings as to whether racial/ethnic disparities remain after other factors, such as income, are taken into account. The objective of this study was to examine the association of race/ethnicity and family income with the prevalence of childhood asthma and to assess whether racial/ethnic disparities vary by income strata.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data on 14,244 children aged {\textless}18 years old in the 1997 National Health Interview Survey were examined. The authors used logistic regression to analyze the independent and joint effects of race/ethnicity and income-to-federal poverty level (FPL) ratio, adjusting for demographic covariates. The main outcome measure was parental report of the child having ever been diagnosed with asthma.
RESULTS: Bivariate analyses, based on weighted percentages, revealed that asthma was more prevalent among non-Hispanic black children (13.6\%) than among non-Hispanic white children (11.2\%; p{\textless}0.01), but the prevalence of asthma did not differ significantly between Hispanic children (10.1\%) and non-Hispanic white children (11.2\%; p=0.13). Overall, non-Hispanic black children were at higher risk for asthma than non-Hispanic white children (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.20; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.03, 1.40), after adjustment for sociodemographic variables, including the ratio of annual family income to the FPL. Asthma prevalence did not differ between Hispanic children and non-Hispanic white children in adjusted analyses (adjusted OR=0.85; 95\% CI 0.71, 1.02). Analyses stratified by income revealed that only among children from families with incomes less than half the FPL did non-Hispanic black children have a higher risk of asthma than non-Hispanic white children (adjusted OR=1.99; 95\% CI 1.09, 3.64). No black vs. white differences existed at other income levels. Subsequent analyses of these very poor children that took into account additional potentially explanatory variables did not attenuate the higher asthma risk for very poor non-Hispanic black children relative to very poor non-Hispanic white children.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-Hispanic black children were at substantially higher risk of asthma than non-Hispanic white children only among the very poor. The concentration of racial/ethnic differences only among the very poor suggests that patterns of social and environmental exposures must overshadow any hypothetical genetic risk.},

	abstract = {Hospitalization rates for asthma in New York City are highest in poor urban neighborhoods, although the reasons for this are unknown. We performed a small area analysis of asthma hospitalization rates in Boston, to determine whether this pattern of asthma hospitalization also obtained in a medium-sized city and to identify characteristics of neighborhoods with high hospitalization rates, including the relative use of inhaled anti-inflammatory medication. Zip codes were used to define 22 small areas within Boston. The number of asthma hospitalizations for residents of each area in 1992 was obtained from the Codman Research Group. Population and demographic characteristics of each area were obtained from the 1990 US Census. Estimates of inhaled asthma medications (beta-agonists, steroids, and cromolyn) dispensed in each area in 1992 were obtained from IMS America. Asthma hospitalization rates for each of the six areas with the highest rates (5.3 to 9.8 per 1,000 persons) were significantly greater than the city-wide average of 4.2 hospitalizations per thousand persons (p {\textless} 0.001 for each comparison). Asthma hospitalization rate was positively correlated with poverty rate and with the proportion of nonwhite residents and inversely correlated with income and educational attainment. Asthma hospitalization rate was inversely correlated with the ratio of inhaled anti-inflammatory to beta-agonist medication use (r = -0.55, p = 0.008). We conclude that asthma hospitalization rates in Boston are highest in poor inner city neighborhoods, and that these high rates affect both genders and all age groups. Underuse of inhaled anti-inflammatory medication may be one of the many factors that contributes to this excess hospitalization.},

A growing body of evidence suggests that something may lack from our societal affluence that has the capacity to provide protection against the development of atopic diseases. Much attention during the last years has been devoted to the hygiene hypothesis. This review outlines the impact of environment and lifestyle, particularly from the perspective of the East–West gradient, on the development of atopic diseases, with a special emphasis on the hygiene hypothesis in its broadest sense.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional data from a completed study of 879 asthmatic children between the ages of 1 and 18 residing in the Greater Toronto Area were used. The database included data on demographics, health status, asthma control, and health-related quality of life. Stepwise forward modeling multiple regression was used to investigate the impact of socioeconomic status on asthma control, based on six control parameters from the 2003 Canadian Pediatric Asthma Consensus Guidelines.
RESULTS: Only 11\% of patients met the requirements for acceptable control, while 20\% had intermediate control, and 69\% had unacceptable asthma control. Children from families in lower income adequacy levels had poorer control.
CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in asthma control between children from families of different socio-economic strata persist, even with adjustment for utilization of primary care services and use of controller medications.},

Health status, therefore, should be of concern to policy makers in every sector, not solely those involved in health policy.

Methods and results In a cross-sectional study, patients ≥65 years of age, classified as having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by their general practitioner and not known with a cardiologist-confirmed diagnosis of heart failure, were invited to our out-patient clinic. Four hundred and five participants underwent an extensive diagnostic work-up, including medical history and physical examination, followed by chest radiography, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and pulmonary function tests. As reference (i.e. ‘gold’) standard the consensus opinion of an expert panel was used. The panel based the diagnosis of heart failure on all available results from the diagnostic assessment, guided by the diagnostic principles of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) for heart failure (i.e., symptoms and echocardiographic systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction). The diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was based on the diagnostic criteria of the Global Initiative (GOLD) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Of 405 participating patients with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 83 (20.5\%, 95\% CI 16.7–24.8) had previously unrecognized heart failure (42 patients systolic, 41 ‘isolated’ diastolic, and none right-sided heart failure). In total, 244 (60.2\%) patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease according to the GOLD criteria and 50 (20.5\%, 95\% CI 15.6–26.1) patients combined with unrecognized heart failure.
Conclusion Unrecognized heart failure is very common in elderly patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: There is increasing interest in the frequency and nature of comorbidities in patients with obstructive lung disease: COPD and asthma. We aimed to quantify baseline rates of comorbidities in COPD and asthma patients and to compare the risks to the general population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Within the UK General Practice Research Database, we compared incident patients with COPD (n = 2,699) and asthma (n = 7,931) physician diagnosed in 1998 with age, gender, time, and practice-matched cohorts. Rates were calculated and relative risks (RRs) were estimated for comorbidities in major organ systems and selected medical events of a priori interest.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: In both COPD and asthma, the total sum of diagnoses related to major organ systems was higher than in their matched population controls. Among incident COPD patients, a frequency {\textgreater} 1\% within the first year after diagnosis was observed for angina, cataracts, bone fractures, osteoporosis, pneumonia, and respiratory infections, the highest being angina with 4.0\%. Compared to the non-COPD cohort, COPD patients were at increased risk for pneumonia (relative risk [RR] = 16.0), osteoporosis (RR = 3.1), respiratory infection (RR = 2.2), myocardial infarction (RR = 1.7), angina (RR = 1.7), fractures (RR = 1.6), and glaucoma (RR = 1.3) [all p {\textless} 0.05]. Of note, 2.0\% of COPD patients had cataracts recorded, but this rate was no different than that of the non-COPD cohort (RR = 0.9). Among incident asthma patients, the occurrence of events was generally lower, likely due to the younger age distribution, except for 4.0\% with respiratory infection (RR = 1.84) and 1.7\% with fractures (RR = 1.5). Angina prevalence was 0.7\% in the asthma cohort and 1.4 times more common than in patients without asthma.
CONCLUSION: COPD and asthma are conditions associated with many comorbidities, albeit asthma to a lesser extent than COPD, which had not been systematically reviewed before. Baseline rates of cardiovascular-, bone-, and other smoking-related conditions are high.},

Although several reports found that women are less likely to receive some in-hospital interventions, most differences disappear after age and comorbidities are accounted for. However, sex disparities persist in the use of thrombolytic treatment (with alteplase) and lipid testing. Functional outcomes and quality of life after stroke are consistently poorer in women, despite adjustment for baseline differences in age, prestroke function, and comorbidities.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to determine the extent to which the variation in conventional risk factors contributed to the variation in stroke incidence among these populations.
METHODS: Within the WHO MONICA Project, stroke has been recorded in 18 populations in 11 countries. In population surveys, risk factors for cardiovascular diseases have been examined in the age group 35 to 64 years. Over a 3-year period, 12,224 acute strokes were registered in men and women within the same age range.
RESULTS: The highest stroke attack rates were found in Novosibirsk in Siberia, Russia, and Finland, with a more than three-fold higher incidence than in Friuli, Italy. The mean diastolic blood pressure among the populations differed by 15 mm Hg between Novosibirsk (highest) and Denmark (lowest). In multiple regression analyses, the presence of conventional cardiovascular risk factors (smoking and elevated blood pressure) explained 21\% of the variation in stroke incidence among the population in men and 42\% in women. In Finland, in China, and in men in Lithuania, the stroke incidence rates were higher than expected from the population risk factor levels.
CONCLUSION: Prevalence of smoking and elevated blood pressure explain a substantial proportion of the variation of stroke attack rates between populations. However, other risk factors for stroke that were not measured in the present study also contribute considerably to interpopulation differences in stroke rates.},

	doi = {10.1056/NEJMoa1203830},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with accelerated loss of lung function and death. Identification of patients at risk for these events, particularly those requiring hospitalization, is of major importance. Severe pulmonary hypertension is an important complication of advanced COPD and predicts acute exacerbations, though pulmonary vascular abnormalities also occur early in the course of the disease. We hypothesized that a computed tomographic (CT) metric of pulmonary vascular disease (pulmonary artery enlargement, as determined by a ratio of the diameter of the pulmonary artery to the diameter of the aorta [PA:A ratio] of {\textgreater}1) would be associated with severe COPD exacerbations.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, observational trial that enrolled current and former smokers with COPD. We determined the association between a PA:A ratio of more than 1 and a history at enrollment of severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization and then examined the usefulness of the ratio as a predictor of these events in a longitudinal follow-up of this cohort, as well as in an external validation cohort. We used logistic-regression and zero-inflated negative binomial regression analyses and adjusted for known risk factors for exacerbation.
RESULTS: Multivariate logistic-regression analysis showed a significant association between a PA:A ratio of more than 1 and a history of severe exacerbations at the time of enrollment in the trial (odds ratio, 4.78; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.43 to 6.65; P{\textless}0.001). A PA:A ratio of more than 1 was also independently associated with an increased risk of future severe exacerbations in both the trial cohort (odds ratio, 3.44; 95\% CI, 2.78 to 4.25; P{\textless}0.001) and the external validation cohort (odds ratio, 2.80; 95\% CI, 2.11 to 3.71; P{\textless}0.001). In both cohorts, among all the variables analyzed, a PA:A ratio of more than 1 had the strongest association with severe exacerbations.
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary artery enlargement (a PA:A ratio of {\textgreater}1), as detected by CT, was associated with severe exacerbations of COPD. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT00608764 and NCT00292552.).},

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a substantial health burden. Cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death, frequently coexists with COPD, an effect attributed to high individual disease prevalences and shared risk factors. It has long been recognized that COPD, whether stable or during acute exacerbations, is associated with an excess of cardiac arrhythmias. Bronchodilator medications have been implicated in the excess CVD seen in COPD, either as an intrinsic medication effect or related to side-effects. Despite the theory behind increased pro-arrhythmic effects in COPD, the reported results of trials investigating this for inhaled formulations at therapeutic doses are few. Methodological flaws, retrospective analysis and inadequate adjustment for concomitant medications, including short-acting 'relief' bronchodilators and non-respiratory medications with known arrhythmia propensity, mar many of these studies. For most bronchodilators at therapeutic levels in stable COPD, we can be reassured of their safety from current studies. The exception to this is ipratropium bromide, where the current data indicate an association with increased cardiovascular adverse effects. Moreover, there is no proven benefit from combining short-acting beta-agonists with short-acting anticholinergics at high doses in the acute setting, and although this practice is widespread, it is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical trial safety database for tiotropium has been augmented with a 4-year trial in patients with COPD, which provides an opportunity to better evaluate the cardiovascular (CV) profile of tiotropium.
METHODS: Trials with the following criteria were considered: {\textgreater} or = 4 weeks, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were similar, including spirometry-confirmed COPD, {\textgreater} or = 10 pack-year smoking, and age {\textgreater} or = 40 years. Adverse events were collected throughout each trial using standardized case report forms. Incidence rates (IRs) were determined from the total number of patients with an event divided by total time at risk. Rate ratios (RRs) and 95\% CI for tiotropium/placebo were calculated. IRs were determined for all-cause mortality and selected CV events, including a composite CV end point encompassing CV deaths, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, and the terms sudden death, sudden cardiac death, and cardiac death.
RESULTS: There were 19,545 patients randomized: 10,846 (tiotropium) and 8,699 (placebo) from 30 trials. Mean FEV(1) = 1.15 +/- 0.46 L (41 +/- 14\% predicted), 76\% men, mean age = 65 +/- 9 years. Cumulative exposure to study drug was 13,146 (tiotropium) and 11,095 (placebo) patient-years. For all-cause mortality, the IR was 3.44 (tiotropium) and 4.10 (placebo) per 100 patient-years (RR [95\% CI] = 0.88 [0.77-0.999]). IR for the CV end point was 2.15 (tiotropium) and 2.67 (placebo) per 100 patient-years (RR [95\% CI] = 0.83 (0.71-0.98]). The IR for the CV mortality excluding nonfatal MI and stroke was 0.91 (tiotropium) and 1.24 (placebo) per 100 patient-years (RR [95\% CI] = 0.77 [0.60-0.98]). For total MI, cardiac failure, and stroke the RRs (95\% CI) were 0.78 (0.59-1.02), 0.82 (0.69-0.98), and 1.03 (0.79-1.35), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Tiotropium was associated with a reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and CV events.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with the use of ipratropium bromide. We sought to examine the association between ipratropium bromide use and the risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs).
METHODS: We performed a cohort study of 82,717 US veterans with a new diagnosis of COPD between 1999 and 2002. Subjects were followed until they had their first hospitalization for a CVE (acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, or cardiac dysrhythmia), they died, or the end of the study period (September 30, 2004). Cumulative anticholinergic exposure was calculated as the number of 30-day equivalents (ipratropium bromide) within the past year. We used Cox regression models with time-dependent covariates to estimate the risk of CVE associated with anticholinergic exposure and to adjust for potential confounders, including markers of COPD severity and cardiovascular risk.
RESULTS: We identified 6,234 CVEs (44\% heart failure, 28\% acute coronary syndrome, 28\% dysrhythmia). Compared with subjects not exposed to anticholinergics within the past year, any exposure to anticholinergics within the past 6 months was associated with an increased risk of CVE (hazard ratio [95\% CI] for{\textless} or =four and{\textgreater}four 30-day equivalents: 1.40 [1.30-1.51] and 1.23 [1.13-1.36], respectively). Among subjects who received anticholinergics more than 6 months prior, there did not appear to be elevated risk of a CVE.
CONCLUSIONS: We found an increased risk of CVEs associated with the use of ipratropium bromide within the past 6 months. These findings are consistent with previous concerns raised about the cardiovascular safety of ipratropium bromide.},

The purpose of this review was to identify the range of adverse events that have been reported to be related to oral corticosteroids, examine the factors that influence their incidence and estimate the economic burden caused by these adverse events. In 61 identified studies, 21 different categories of OCS related adverse events were reported with increased fracture risk being the category most frequently described. Most studies that examined factors linked to the incidence of OCS related adverse events found that dose, age, gender, duration of use, treatment history, smoking habits or cholesterol level were influential in determining risk. Additionally, a cumulative economic analysis of selected adverse events found the annual cost of treating these events in the UK to be at least 165 pounds per patient taking OCS. The clinical and economic burden of OCS related adverse events highlights the need for OCS sparing therapies to be developed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Due to overlapping symptoms and inadequate exercise capacity, noninvasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) may be under- or overestimated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes of coronary angiography in COPD patients depending on baseline clinical characteristics.
METHODS: Medical records of 157 patients with COPD and 157 patients without COPD matched for baseline clinical characteristics who had undergone diagnostic coronary angiography for the first time were reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS: The frequency of significant CAD was significantly lower in COPD patients than in the control group (52.8\% vs. 80.2\%, p{\textless}0.001). Frequencies of CAD risk factors (older age, hypertension, diabetes, smoking history) were significantly more frequent among COPD patients having significant CAD. Among patients reporting stable angina pectoris, significant CAD was detected in 32.7\% of COPD patients and 71.0\% of non-COPD patients (p{\textless}0.001). However, among the patients with a diagnosis of unstable angina pectoris, significant CAD was detected in 87.5\% of COPD patients and 90.2\% of non-COPD patients (p=0.755).
CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of CAD in COPD patients by symptomatology may be difficult. However, clinical diagnosis of CAD in the setting of unstable angina is accurate in most of the COPD patients. Therefore, further noninvasive diagnostic methods or careful follow up may be more appropriate for COPD patients reporting stable angina pectoris.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are usually former or current smokers, and are at increased risk of ischemic heart disease. We used Cardiac Infarction Injury Score (CIIS) to assess the prevalence of prior myocardical infarction (MI) in COPD patients and compared this to clinicians' previous diagnosis of MI.
METHODS: From the hospital database, 897 patients (mean age 70.9 years, 50.8\% female) discharged after treatment for COPD exacerbation in the years 2000-2003 were identified. Disease history was established from medical records and the hospital patient database. Electrocardiograms from the day of admission were available in 827 patients, and were coded according to the CIIS algorithm by an investigator blinded to clinical and outcome data. The CIIS score was validated using follow-up data for the first year after discharge.
RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-nine patients had CIIS {\textgreater} or = 20, out of whom only 30\% (95\% confidence interval: 24-36\%, n=68) had a recognised history of MI. Female patients had a lower probability of diagnosis despite ECG evidence. Validation of CIIS using multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that a score {\textgreater} or = 20 had independent prognostic value for the first year after discharge, with an adjusted HR of 1.52 (1.14-2.03).
CONCLUSION: Unrecognised MI is common in patients hospitalised with COPD exacerbation. Less than one-third of patients with ECG evidence of previous MI by the CIIS system actually have the diagnosis in their medical records.},

To recruit controls, a random sample was taken of 676 individuals who were 40 years and older and who were not diagnosed as having asthma or COPD by their general practitioner. Of these 676 individuals 421 were willing to participate. The presence of diseases was determined by using a questionnaire. One hundred and ninety-four subjects (73\%) and 229 controls (63\%) were shown to be suffering from one or more (other) diseases. In both groups, locomotive diseases, high blood pressure, insomnia and heart disease were most common. Locomotive diseases, insomnia, sinusitis, migraine, depression, stomach or duodenal ulcers and cancer were significantly more common in the subject group than in the control group.

We assessed the extent of myocardial infarction and other co-morbidities in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the general population.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used individual participant data for the entire Danish population from 1980 through 2006, comprising 140 million person-years of follow-up. We used information from four national Danish registries with 100\% follow-up and detected ever-diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 313,958) and incident cases of a first myocardial infarction (n = 422,344), lung cancer (n = 116,629), hip fracture (n = 53,756), depression (n = 93 038), and diabetes mellitus (n = 292 228). Multivariate adjusted hazard ratios for life-time association with ever-diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were 1.26 (95\% CI 1.25-1.27) for myocardial infarction, 2.05 (2.03-2.08) for lung cancer, 2.12 (2.07-2.17) for hip fracture, 1.74 (1.70-1.77) for depression, and 1.21 (1.20-1.23) for diabetes mellitus, compared with controls; these risk estimates were highest in women and the youngest age groups. Before the first hospitalization with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, multivariate adjusted odds ratios were 1.47 (1.44-1.49) for myocardial infarction, 3.68 (3.52-3.84) for lung cancer, 1.16 (1.13-1.18) for hip fracture, 1.88 (1.80-1.96) for depression, and 1.16 (1.13-1.18) for diabetes mellitus, compared with matched controls. Corresponding values after a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hospitalization were 0.74 (0.73-0.76), 1.48 (1.45-1.51), 1.23 (1.20-1.27), 1.21 (1.18-1.24), and 0.83 (0.81-0.85), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was associated with higher rates of myocardial infarction, lung cancer, diabetes, hip fracture, and depression, but the strength of these associations was modified after a first admission for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These associations may be related to common genetic and/or lifestyle/environmental risk factors, and therefore these factors are likely to have an adverse health impact rather than chronic obstructive pulmonary disease per se.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increases the risk of cardiovascular disease 2- to 3-fold. The factors responsible for this association remain largely unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed data from participants, {\textgreater} or =50 years of age, of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n=6629) to determine whether C-reactive protein (CRP) and other systemic inflammatory markers are present in participants with chronic airflow obstruction and are associated with cardiac injury. Participants with severe airflow obstruction had circulating leukocyte, platelet, and fibrinogen levels that were 460/ microL (95\% confidence interval [CI], 30 to 890/ microL), 39 510/ microL (95\% CI, 21 730 to 57 290/ microL), and 41.63 mg/dL (95\% CI, 19.87 to 63.39 mg/dL) higher, respectively, than in those without airflow obstruction. They were also 2.18 times (95\% CI, 1.46 to 3.27) more likely to have an elevated circulating CRP level. Moderate airflow obstruction was associated with smaller but still significant increases in these levels. Moderate and severe airflow obstruction was associated with increased occurrence of ischemic changes on electrocardiograms of participants. In the presence of both highly elevated CRP and moderate or severe airflow obstruction, the Cardiac Infarction Injury Score was 2.68 and 5.88 U higher, respectively, than in those without airflow obstruction and with low CRP, which suggests an additive effect of CRP and COPD on the risk of cardiac injury.
CONCLUSION: Low-grade systemic inflammation was present in participants with moderate to severe airflow obstruction and was associated with increased risk of cardiac injury. This may in part explain the high rates of cardiovascular complications in COPD.},

DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort study.
SETTING: Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program (KPNC), a comprehensive prepaid integrated health-care system.
PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Case patients (n = 45,966) were all KPNC members with COPD who were identified during a 4-year period from January 1996 through December 1999. An equal number of control subjects without COPD were selected from KPNC membership and were matched for gender, year of birth, and length of KPNC membership.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Follow-up conducted for hospitalization and mortality from CVD end points through December 31, 2000. CVD study end points included cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure (CHF), stroke, pulmonary embolism, all of the aforementioned study end points combined, other CVD, and all CVD end points. The mean follow-up time was 2.75 years for case patients and 2.99 years for control subjects. The risk of hospitalization was higher in COPD case patients than in control subjects for all CVD hospitalization and mortality end points. The relative risk (RR) for hospitalization for the composite measure of all study end points was 2.09 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.99 to 2.20) after adjustment for gender, preexisting CVD study end points, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, and ranged from 1.33 (stroke) to 3.75 (CHF). The adjusted RR for mortality for the composite measure of all study end points was 1.68 (95\% CI, 1.50 to 1.88), ranging from 1.25 (stroke) to 3.53 (CHF). Younger patients (ie, age {\textless} 65 years) and female patients had higher risks than older and male participants.
CONCLUSIONS: COPD was a predictor of CVD hospitalization and mortality over an average follow-up time of nearly 3 years. The finding of a stronger relationship of COPD to CVD outcomes in patients {\textless} 65 years of age suggests that CVD risk should be monitored and treated with particular care in younger adults with COPD.},

We used the UK-based General Practice Research Database (GPRD) to assess the prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular diseases in COPD patients aged 40-79 between 1995 and 2005, and we randomly matched COPD-free comparison patients to COPD patients. In nested-case control analyses, we compared the risks of developing an incident diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, or stroke between patients with and without COPD, stratifying the analyses by COPD-severity, using COPD-treatment as proxy for disease severity. We identified 35,772 patients with COPD and the same number of COPD-free patients. Most cardiovascular diseases were more prevalent among COPD patients than among the comparison group of COPD-free patients. The relative risk estimates of developing an incident diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia (OR 1.19, 95\% CI 0.98-1.43), deep vein thrombosis (OR 1.35, 95\% CI 0.97-1.89), pulmonary embolism (OR 2.51, 95\% CI 1.62-3.87), myocardial infarction (OR 1.40, 95\% CI 1.13-1.73), or stroke (OR 1.13, 95\% CI 0.92-1.38), tended to be increased for patients with COPD as compared to COPD-free controls. The findings of this large observational study provide further evidence that patients with COPD are at increased risk for most cardiovascular diseases.},

Information about the prevalence and incidence of these conditions is needed to anticipate their occurrence in clinical research.

The COPD cohort included all persons with a diagnosis of COPD admitted to a Veterans Administration Medical System hospital (N = 70,679) or seen in a outpatient clinic (N = 314,209) in fiscal year 1998. Each COPD patient was matched to a Veteran of the same age and gender who did not have a COPD diagnosis, creating a non-COPD cohort for comparison. Among all hospitalized Veterans, the prevalence of COPD steadily increased from 1991 to 1999, although the total number of Veterans hospitalized during this time period decreased by more than one-third. Among COPD patients hospitalized in 1998, the prevalence of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation were very high (33.6\%, 24.4\%, and 14.3\%, respectively) and significantly higher than those seen among the matched non-COPD cohort (27.1\%, 13.5\%, and 10.4\%; p {\textless} 0.001). Among COPD outpatients, increased complications were found in every CV disease category with rate ratios that were greater than observed among inpatients.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey performed in a 174,484-member regional HMO and in The University of New Mexico Hospitals and Clinics (UNMH).
PATIENTS: Two hundred COPD patients from each system randomly selected from administrative databases based on discharge diagnoses.
RESULTS: COPD patients in the UMC, compared to those in the HMO, were younger (mean age, 59.3 vs 66.9 years, respectively), were more likely to be using home oxygen (33\% vs 20\%, respectively), and had fewer chronic medical conditions (mean number of conditions, 3.1 vs 3.7, respectively) (p {\textless} 0.01 for all differences). Approximately half of the COPD patients in both groups continued to smoke cigarettes during the study year. Only 38\% of patients in the HMO and 42\% in the UNMH system had spirometry results documented in their medical records.
CONCLUSIONS: The demographic and clinical characteristics of the COPD patients in these two health-care systems were very different, but smoking status and utilization of diagnostic tests were similar. The diagnosis of COPD in most patients was based only on a history of chronic respiratory symptoms and smoking; spirometry often was not used to confirm the diagnosis. An increased emphasis on smoking cessation and more effective utilization of spirometry are needed to improve the management of COPD in these health-care systems.},

The sample was stratified based on baseline lung function data, according to modified Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria. Comorbid disease at baseline and death and hospitalisations over a 5-yr follow-up were then searched for. Lung function impairment was found to be associated with more comorbid disease. In logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking, body mass index and education, subjects with GOLD stage 3 or 4 COPD had a higher prevalence of diabetes (odds ratio (OR) 1.5, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-1.9), hypertension (OR 1.6, 95\% CI 1.3-1.9) and cardiovascular disease (OR 2.4, 95\% CI 1.9-3.0). Comorbid disease was associated with a higher risk of hospitalisation and mortality that was worse in people with impaired lung function. Lung function impairment is associated with a higher risk of comorbid disease, which contributes to a higher risk of adverse outcomes of mortality and hospitalisations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A relationship between local and systemic inflammation and different co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular, has been discussed in relation to disease process and prognosis in COPD.
AIM: To evaluate if conditions as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic rhinitis and gastroesophageal reflux are overrepresented in COPD.
METHODS: All subjects with COPD according to GOLD, FEV(1)/FVC{\textless}0.70, were identified (n = 993) from the clinical follow-up in 2002-04 of the OLIN (Obstructive Lung Disease in Northern Sweden) studies' cohorts together with 993 gender- and age-matched reference subjects without COPD (non-COPD, further divided into normal and restrictive lung function). Interview data on co-morbidity and symptoms were used.
RESULTS: Cardiovascular co-morbidity, taken together heart disease, hypertension, stroke and intermittent claudication, was the most common and higher in COPD compared to in normal lung function (Nlf) 50.1\% vs 41.0\% (p{\textless}0.001). The prevalence of chronic rhinitis and gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) was higher in COPD compared to in Nlf (43.1\% vs 32.3\%, p{\textless}0.001 and 16.7\% vs 12.0\%, p = 0.011). In restrictive lung function the prevalence of chronic rhinitis, cardiovascular disease, hyperlipemia and diabetes was higher compared to in Nlf (41.0\% vs 32.3\%, p = 0.017, 59.0\% vs 41.0\%, p{\textless}0.001, 29.2\% vs.12.9\%, p = 0.033, 20.9\% vs 8.6\%, p {\textless}0.001). In COPD and heart disease, 62.5\% had chronic rhinitis and/or GERD, while in Nlf the corresponding proportion was 42.5\%.
CONCLUSION: Co-morbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease, chronic rhinitis and gastroesophageal reflux were common in COPD. The overlap between heart disease, chronic rhinitis and GERD was large in COPD. Restrictive lung function did also identify a population with increased disease burden.},

The prevalence of COPD was 5.7\% for mild COPD (GOLD stage 1), 9.4\% for moderate COPD (GOLD stage 2) and 2.5\% for severe and very severe COPD (GOLD stages 3+4). Individuals with COPD were older and had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. Among the echocardiographical findings, only the presence of left ventricular hyperthrophy was significantly more frequent among individuals with COPD (17.7\%) than among participants without COPD (12.1\%.), yet this relationship was no longer significant after statistical adjustment for age and gender. In the general population, subjects with COPD have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and an unfavourable cardiovascular risk profile compared with individuals without COPD, but this was mainly related to higher age among the participants with COPD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anaemia is common and associated with impaired long-term survival and quality of life. Whether anaemia is also prevalent in patients with other severe, non-inflammatory respiratory diseases has not yet been systematically tested.
METHODS: In 595 patients with obstructive (OD, 54.8\%) or restrictive disease (RD, 45.2\%) and chronic respiratory failure (CRF), anthropometric data, laboratory parameters, lung function, blood gases and comorbidities were assessed prior to initiation of home mechanical ventilation. Patients were classified as anaemic based on haemoglobin (Hb) levels (Hb{\textless}12/13 g/dl, female patients/male patients). Patients with known causes for anaemia were excluded.
RESULTS: In patients with CRF the prevalence of anaemia was 13.3\% and not different between RD (11.5\%) and OD (14.7\%) (p=0.276). A sex-related difference occurred only in OD [7.9\% (f) vs. 17.3\% (m); p=0.035]. Patients with OD and anaemia presented with higher age (p=0.003), pH (p=0.014) and arterial oxygen pressure (PaO(2) ) (p=0.012), lower body mass index (BMI) (p=0.011) and total protein (p=0.012) and higher rates of coronary heart disease (p=0.01), cardiac arrhythmia (p=0.014) and diabetes mellitus (p=0.003) in comparison to non-anaemic patients. In patients with RD anaemia was associated with higher age, (p=0.008), pH (p=0.011) and lower leucocytes numbers (p=0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: Anaemia is frequent not only in COPD but also in other severe respiratory diseases combined with CRF. It was associated with advanced age, several comorbidities, impaired nutritional state and elevations of pH and PaO(2) , probably because of hyperventilation. Its prognostic impact has to be elucidated in future studies.},

DESIGN: From the National Hospital Discharge Survey, 1979 to 2001, we evaluated whether or not COPD in adults {\textgreater} or = 25 years old is associated with increased prevalence and in-hospital mortality of several comorbidities.
RESULTS: During 1979 to 2001, there were an estimated total of 47,404,700 hospital discharges (8.5\% of all hospitalizations in adults {\textgreater} 25 years old) of patients with COPD; 37,540,374 discharges (79.2\%) were made with COPD as a secondary diagnosis, and 9,864,278 discharges (20.8\%) were made with COPD as the primary diagnosis. The prevalence and in-hospital mortality for pneumonia, congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, thoracic malignancies, and respiratory failure were larger in hospital discharges with any mention of COPD.
CONCLUSIONS: In a nationally representative sample of hospitalizations, any mention of COPD in the discharge diagnosis is associated with higher hospitalization prevalence and in-hospital mortality from other comorbidities. These results highlight the fact that the burden of disease associated with COPD is likely underestimated.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The current debate about the lower limit of normal (LLN) vs the 0.7 fixed ratio to diagnose COPD is not completely resolved, and little information about the clinical impact of these different criteria is available. We compared differences in health-related quality of life, exacerbations, exercise tolerance, physical activity, comorbidity, and systemic biomarkers of subjects with FEV(1)/FVC {\textless} 0.7 but {\textgreater} LLN (ratio-only group) vs subjects without COPD and those with mild or moderate to severe COPD.
METHODS: A population-based sample of 3,802 subjects aged 40 to 80 years from the Epidemiologic Study of COPD in Spain was selected. Subjects were evaluated with postbronchodilator spirometry, quality-of-life and physical activity questionnaires, and 6-min walk tests. Exacerbations within the previous year and comorbidities were recorded. Systemic biomarkers were measured after excluding subjects with conditions associated with systemic inflammatory processes.
RESULTS: Fixed-ratio COPD overdiagnosis affects up to 4.6\% of subjects aged 40 to 80 years, is more frequent in men, and increases with age. After adjusting for confounding factors, the ratio-only group had a worse health-related quality of life than the non-COPD group, with poorer scores in all questionnaire domains (P {\textless} .05). However, no differences between the two groups for respiratory exacerbations, 6-min walk distance, physical activity, or systemic biomarkers were observed. Ratio-only subjects did not present greater risk for cardiovascular disease (adjusted relative OR, 1.47; 95\% CI, 0.81-2.64), whereas subjects with mild COPD did (adjusted relative OR, 2.32; 95\% CI, 1.11-4.84).
CONCLUSIONS: Subjects receiving a diagnosis of COPD by the fixed ratio present worse self-reported quality of life than subjects without COPD but had similar exercise, frequency of exacerbations, and indices of systemic effects.},

	volume = {4},
	issn = {1178-2005},
	abstract = {RATIONALE: Recent studies described association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In their analysis none of these studies accounted for sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, and patient comorbidities simultaneously.
OBJECTIVE: To study whether COPD diagnosis is an independent risk factor for CVD.
METHODS: Subjects aged 40 years and older (N = 18,342) from the sample adult file of the 2002 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) were included in the analysis. Chi-squared tests and odds ratios (OR) were utilized to compare the data. Multiple logistic regression was employed to analyze the association between COPD and CVD with simultaneous control for sociodemographic factors (age, gender, race, marital status, education, income), health behaviors (tobacco use, alcohol consumption, physical activity), and patient comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and obesity). The analysis employed NHIS sampling weights to generate data representative of the entire US population.
RESULTS: The COPD population had increased prevalence of CVD (56.5\% vs 25.6\%; P {\textless} 0.0001). Adjusted logistic regression showed that COPD patients (N = 958) were at higher risk of having coronary heart disease (OR = 2.0, 95\% CI: 1.5-2.5), angina (OR = 2.1, 95\% CI: 1.6-2.7), myocardial infarction (OR = 2.2, 95\% CI: 1.7-2.8), stroke (OR = 1.5, 95\% CI: 1.1-2.1), congestive heart failure (OR = 3.9, 95\% CI: 2.8-5.5), poor circulation in lower extremities (OR = 2.5, 95\% CI: 2.0-3.0), and arrhythmia (OR = 2.4, 95\% CI: 2.0-2.8). Overall, the presence of COPD increased the odds of having CVD by a factor of 2.7 (95\% CI: 2.3-3.2).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the conclusion that COPD is an independent risk factor for CVD.},

A study was undertaken to quantify the burden of comorbidity and to determine the risk of first acute arteriovascular events among individuals with COPD.
METHODS: The computerised primary care records of 1,204,100 members of the general population aged ≥ 35 years on 25 February 2005 were searched for recordings of each disease. Data were analysed using multivariate logistic regression. Cox regression was used to determine whether individuals with COPD were at increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke.
RESULTS: Cross-sectional analyses showed that physician-diagnosed COPD was associated with increased risks of CVD (OR 4.98, 95\% CI 4.85 to 5.81; p{\textless}0.001), stroke (OR 3.34, 95\% CI 3.21 to 3.48; p{\textless}0.001) and DM (OR 2.04, 95\% CI 1.97 to 2.12; p{\textless}0.001). In the follow-up analyses, after adjusting for confounding by sex and smoking status and stratifying for age, the greatest increase in the rate of acute arteriovascular events was found in the youngest age groups; the HR for acute MI was 10.34 (95\% CI 3.28 to 32.60; p{\textless}0.001) and for stroke the HR was 3.44 (95\% CI 0.85 to 13.84; p{\textless}0.001) compared with the oldest age group.
CONCLUSION: Individuals with COPD are substantially more likely to have pre-existing CVD, DM or a previous stroke and are at high risk of acute arteriovascular events. National COPD guidelines and models of care need to adapt to provide an integrated approach to addressing these comorbidities.},

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study in longitudinal health care databases maintained by the government of Saskatchewan, Canada. Subjects were persons age 40 years or older who were diagnosed with COPD during 1997-2000 and who received two or more prescriptions for bronchodilators within 6 months of diagnosis. Each subject was matched by age and sex to two controls without COPD or asthma.
RESULTS: Of COPD patients (n = 11,493), 54\% were male, and 74\% were 65 years or older. Prevalence of all cardiovascular diseases was higher in the COPD group than in the comparison group. After adjusting for cardiovascular risk, odds ratios of prevalence were: arrhythmia 1.76 (confidence interval [CI]: 1.64-1.89), angina 1.61 (CI: 1.47-1.76), acute myocardial infarction 1.61 (CI: 1.43-1.81), congestive heart failure 3.84(CI: 3.56-4.14), stroke 1.11 (CI: 1.02-1.21), pulmonary embolism 5.46 (CI: 4.25-7.02).

METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective study using information obtained from the HSD. The software system used codes all the diagnostic records using the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases.
RESULTS: Compared to the non-COPD people, COPD patients were at increased risk for cardiovascular events [ischemic heart disease (6.9\% in the general population vs. 13.6\% in COPD patients), cardiac arrhythmia (6.6\% in the general population vs. 15.9\% in COPD patients), heart failure (2.0\% in the general population vs. 7.9\% in COPD patients), and other forms of heart disease (10.7\% in the general population vs. 23.1\% in COPD patients); with a higher impact of COPD in the elderly]; non-psychotic mental disorders, including depressive disorders (29.1\% in the general population vs. 41.6\% in COPD patients; with a higher impact of COPD on women aged {\textless}75 years); diabetes mellitus (10.5\% in the general population vs. 18.7\% in COPD patients); osteoporosis (10.8\% in the general population vs. 14.8\% in COPD patients), with a higher impact of COPD on women aged {\textless}75 years, and malignant pulmonary neoplasms (0.4\% in the general population vs. 1.9\% in COPD patients).

After controlling for age and sex, a significantly higher percentage of patients with COPD (45\%) reported pain than the general population (34\%; P = .02). No differences were found in pain intensity scores, pain interference score, or number of pain locations between COPD patients and the general population. COPD patients reported moderate-to-severe pain located primarily in the chest, shoulders, neck, and thorax. For both groups, the most common pain treatment was analgesic use. Acupuncture/transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation was used more frequently by COPD patients (P {\textless} .001) while physiotherapy was used more frequently by the general population (P = .007) to treat their pain.

Multivariate analysis of covariance or Kruskal Wallis tests were used to compare health status indexes across the spectrum of GOLD stages of COPD severity. GOLD stages of COPD severity significantly differed in SGRQ components and Barthel's index, but not in the indexes assessing cognitive and affective status and quality of sleep. The largest variation in health status was observed at the transition from stage IIa to stage IIb, while there were no other significant differences between consecutive stages. Both female sex and comorbidity were associated with a greater impact of COPD on the health status. In conclusion, the upper limit of stage IIb (forced expiratory volume in one second of 49\%) marks a threshold for dramatic worsening of health status. Progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease severity from stage 0 to stage IIa does not correspond to any meaningful difference in health status.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify if there is a dose-dependent risk of diabetes complications in patients treated with corticosteroids who have both diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective study of administrative claims data from the Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs, from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2008, of diabetes patients newly initiated on metformin or sulfonylurea. COPD was identified by dispensings of tiotropium or ipratropium in the 6 months preceding study entry. Total corticosteroid use (inhaled and systemic) in the 12 months after study entry was determined. The outcome was time to hospitalization for a diabetes-related complication. Competing risks and Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were conducted with adjustment for a number of covariates.
RESULTS: A total of 18,226 subjects with diabetes were identified, of which 5.9\% had COPD. Of those with COPD, 67.2\% were dispensed corticosteroids in the 12 months from study entry. Stratification by dose of corticosteroids demonstrated a 94\% increased likelihood of hospitalization for a diabetes complication for those who received a total defined daily dose (DDD) of corticosteroids≥0.83/day (subhazard ratio 1.94 [95\% CI 1.14-3.28], P=0.014), by comparison with those who did not receive a corticosteroid. Lower doses of corticosteroid ({\textless}0.83 DDD/day) were not associated with an increased risk of diabetes-related hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with diabetes and COPD, an increased risk of diabetes-related hospitalizations was only evident with use of high doses of corticosteroids. This highlights the need for constant revision of corticosteroid dose in those with diabetes and COPD, to ensure that the minimally effective dose is used, together with review of appropriate response to therapy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality.Patients with COPD have a cardiovascular risk three times greater than the normal population and cardiac disease accounts for about 50\% of deaths in these patients. Arterial stiffness is a marker of increased cardiovascular risk and a predictor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. There is evidence of increased aortic stiffness in COPD. The aim of our study is to determine parameters of carotid arterial stiffness in patients with stable COPD.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 38 patients with COPD and 36 matched controls. All subjects were evaluated by clinical history and spirometry; parameters of carotid stiffness (beta stiffness index - 13 stiffness index, arterial compliance - AC, pulse wave velocity - PWV, augmentation index - AIx) were determined using an ultrasound device (ALOKA ProSound a 10).
RESULTS: Patients with COPD have increased markers of arterial stiffness compared to controls (B stiffness index,p=0.03; AC, p=0.002; carotid PWV, p{\textless}0.001; Alx, p{\textless}0.001). There were no differences between the two groups regarding the classical cardiovascular risk factors with the exception of smoking history. Patients with severe pulmonary disease had more increased 13 stiffness index and PWV than those with mild and moderate disease(p=0.03, respectively p=0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD had increased carotid arterial stiffness. In severe forms of COPD, arterial stiffness seems to be more important than in mild and moderate pulmonary disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) is widely used as a measure of health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with COPD. This study tested whether the SGRQ predicts the survival of patients with COPD.
METHODS: The study recruited 238 patients with COPD who were participants in the multicentre Salute Respiratoria nell'Anziano (Sa.R.A.) study. Patients' sociodemographic, clinical and functional characteristics were assessed and the association between the SGRQ and mortality, corrected for potential confounders, was estimated.
RESULTS: The mean age of study participants was 72.6 years. Over the 5-year observation period there were 88 deaths. After adjustment for potential confounders, the SGRQ score was associated with an increased risk of dying (hazard ratio (HR): 1.22 for four-point increments; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.45). There was no association between mortality and the Symptoms subscale (corrected HR: 1.13; 95\% CI: 0.96-1.32), whereas each four-point increment of the Activity (HR: 1.20; 95\% CI: 1.00-1.43) and Impact (HR: 1.38; 95\% CI: 1.03-1.83) subscale scores were associated with increased mortality. Higher FEV(1) relative to predicted (HR: 0.73 for each 5\% increment; 95\% CI: 0.58-0.91) and better performance at the 6-min walking test relative to predicted (HR: 0.93 for each 5\% increment; 95\% CI: 0.89-0.97) were associated with lower mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly COPD patients, the SGRQ can improve prognostic models based on classical indicators of disease severity.},

	abstract = {Appropriate methods for meta-regression applied to a set of clinical trials, and the limitations and pitfalls in interpretation, are insufficiently recognized. Here we summarize recent research focusing on these issues, and consider three published examples of meta-regression in the light of this work. One principal methodological issue is that meta-regression should be weighted to take account of both within-trial variances of treatment effects and the residual between-trial heterogeneity (that is, heterogeneity not explained by the covariates in the regression). This corresponds to random effects meta-regression. The associations derived from meta-regressions are observational, and have a weaker interpretation than the causal relationships derived from randomized comparisons. This applies particularly when averages of patient characteristics in each trial are used as covariates in the regression. Data dredging is the main pitfall in reaching reliable conclusions from meta-regression. It can only be avoided by prespecification of covariates that will be investigated as potential sources of heterogeneity. However, in practice this is not always easy to achieve. The examples considered in this paper show the tension between the scientific rationale for using meta-regression and the difficult interpretative problems to which such analyses are prone.},

We evaluated standard error, precision (inverse of standard error), variance, inverse of variance, sample size and log sample size (vertical axis) and log odds ratio, log risk ratio and risk difference (horizontal axis). Standard error is likely to be the best choice for the vertical axis: the expected shape in the absence of bias corresponds to a symmetrical funnel, straight lines to indicate 95\% confidence intervals can be included and the plot emphasises smaller studies which are more prone to bias. Precision or inverse of variance is useful when comparing meta-analyses of small trials with subsequent large trials. The use of sample size or log sample size is problematic because the expected shape of the plot in the absence of bias is unpredictable. We found similar evidence for asymmetry and between trial variation in a sample of 78 published meta-analyses whether odds ratios or risk ratios were used on the horizontal axis. Different conclusions were reached for risk differences and this was related to increased between-trial variation. We conclude that funnel plots of meta-analyses should generally use standard error as the measure of study size and ratio measures of treatment effect.},

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death, frequently coexists with COPD, an effect attributed to high individual disease prevalences and shared risk factors. It has long been recognized that COPD, whether stable or during acute exacerbations, is associated with an excess of cardiac arrhythmias. Bronchodilator medications have been implicated in the excess CVD seen in COPD, either as an intrinsic medication effect or related to side-effects. Despite the theory behind increased pro-arrhythmic effects in COPD, the reported results of trials investigating this for inhaled formulations at therapeutic doses are few. Methodological flaws, retrospective analysis and inadequate adjustment for concomitant medications, including short-acting 'relief' bronchodilators and non-respiratory medications with known arrhythmia propensity, mar many of these studies. For most bronchodilators at therapeutic levels in stable COPD, we can be reassured of their safety from current studies. The exception to this is ipratropium bromide, where the current data indicate an association with increased cardiovascular adverse effects. Moreover, there is no proven benefit from combining short-acting beta-agonists with short-acting anticholinergics at high doses in the acute setting, and although this practice is widespread, it is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.},

Since the previous CTS management recommendations were published in 2003, a wealth of new scientific information has become available. The implications of this new knowledge with respect to optimal clinical care have been carefully considered by the CTS Panel and the conclusions are presented in the current document. Highlights of this update include new epidemiological information on mortality and prevalence of COPD, which charts its emergence as a major health problem for women; a new section on common comorbidities in COPD; an increased emphasis on the meaningful benefits of combined pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies; and a new discussion on the prevention of acute exacerbations. A revised stratification system for severity of airway obstruction is proposed, together with other suggestions on how best to clinically evaluate individual patients with this complex disease. The results of the largest randomized clinical trial ever undertaken in COPD have recently been published, enabling the Panel to make evidence-based recommendations on the role of modern pharmacotherapy. The Panel hopes that these new practice guidelines, which reflect a rigorous analysis of the recent literature, will assist caregivers in the diagnosis and management of this common condition.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, and muscle wasting. Systemic inflammation may be involved in the pathogenesis of these disorders. A study was undertaken to determine whether systemic inflammation is present in stable COPD.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of studies which reported on the relationship between COPD, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) or forced vital capacity (FVC), and levels of various systemic inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, leucocytes, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukins 6 and 8. Where possible the results were pooled together to produce a summary estimate using a random or fixed effects model.
RESULTS: Fourteen original studies were identified. Overall, the standardised mean difference in the CRP level between COPD and control subjects was 0.53 units (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.72). The standardised mean difference in the fibrinogen level was 0.47 units (95\% CI 0.29 to 0.65). Circulating leucocytes were also higher in COPD than in control subjects (standardised mean difference 0.44 units (95\% CI 0.20 to 0.67)), as were serum TNF-alpha levels (standardised mean difference 0.59 units (95\% CI 0.29 to 0.89)).
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced lung function is associated with increased levels of systemic inflammatory markers which may have important pathophysiological and therapeutic implications for subjects with stable COPD.},

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) poses a significant economic burden on society, and a substantial portion is related to exacerbations of COPD. A literature review of the direct and indirect costs of COPD exacerbations was performed. A systematic search of the MEDLINE database from 1998-2008 was conducted and supplemented with searches of conference abstracts and article bibliographies. Articles that contained cost data related to COPD exacerbations were selected for in-depth review. Eleven studies examining healthcare costs associated with COPD exacerbations were identified. The estimated costs of exacerbations vary widely across studies: \$88 to \$7,757 per exacerbation (2007 US dollars). The largest component of the total costs of COPD exacerbations was typically hospitalization. Costs were highly correlated with exacerbation severity. Indirect costs have rarely been measured. The wide variability in the cost estimates reflected cross-study differences in geographic locations, treatment patterns, and patient populations. Important methodological differences also existed across studies. Researchers have used different definitions of exacerbation (e.g., symptom- versus event-based definitions), different tools to identify and measure exacerbations, and different classification systems to define exacerbation severity. Unreported exacerbations are common and may influence the long-term costs of exacerbations. Measurement of indirect costs will provide a more comprehensive picture of the burden of exacerbations. Evaluation of pharmacoeconomic analyses would be aided by the use of more consistent and comprehensive approaches to defining and measuring COPD exacerbations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 210 million people are estimated to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] worldwide. The burden of disease is known to be high, though less is known about those of a younger age. The aim of this study was to investigate the wider personal, economic and societal burden of COPD on a cross country working-age cohort.
METHODS: A cross-country [Brazil, China, Germany, Turkey, US, UK] cross-sectional survey methodology was utilised to answer the research questions. 2426 participants aged 45-67 recruited via a number of recruitment methods specific to each country completed the full survey. Inclusion criteria were a recalled physician diagnosis of COPD, a smoking history of {\textgreater} 10 pack years and the use of COPD medications in the previous 3 months prior to questioning. The survey included items from the validated Work Productivity and Activity Impairment [WPAI] scale and the EuroQoL 5 Dimension [EQ-5D] scale. Disease severity was measured using the 5-point MRC [Medical Research Council] dyspnoea scale as a surrogate measure.
RESULTS: 64\% had either moderate [n = 1012] or severe [n = 521] COPD, although this varied by country. 75\% of the cohort reported at least one comorbid condition. Quality of life declined with severity of illness [mild, mean EQ-5D score = 0.84; moderate 0.58; severe 0.41]. The annual cost of healthcare utilisation [excluding treatment costs and diagnostic tests] per individual was estimated to be \$2,364 [£1,500]. For those remaining in active employment [n: 677]: lost time from work cost the individual an average of \$880 [£556] per annum and lifetime losses of \$7,365 [£4,661] amounting to \$596,000 [£377,000] for the cohort. 447 [{\textasciitilde}40\%] of the working population had retired prematurely because of COPD incurring individual estimated lifetime income losses of \$316,000 [£200,000] or a combined total of \$141 m [£89.6 m]. As the mean age of retirees was 58.3 and average time since retirement was 4 years, this suggests the average age of retirement is around 54. This would mean a high societal and economic impact in all study countries, particularly where typical state retirement ages are higher, for example in Brazil, Germany and the UK [65] and the US [65,66,67], compared to Turkey [58 for women, 60 for men] and China [60].
CONCLUSIONS: Although generalisation across a broader COPD population is limited due to the varied participant recruitment methods, these data nevertheless suggest that COPD has significant personal, economic and societal burden on working age people. Further efforts to improve COPD diagnosis and management are required.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease increasingly prevalent in the U.S., particularly among children and certain minority groups. This umbrella review sought to assess and summarize existing systematic reviews of asthma-related interventions that might be carried out or supported by state or community asthma control programs, and to identify gaps in knowledge.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Eleven databases were searched through September 2010, using terms related to four concepts: asthma, review, intervention, and NOT medication. Reviews of the effectiveness of medications, medical procedures, complementary and alternative medicine, psychological interventions, family therapy, and nutrients or nutritional supplements were excluded. Two coders screened each record and extracted data from the included reviews.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Data analysis was conducted from May to December 2010. Of 42 included reviews, 19 assessed the effectiveness of education and/or self-management, nine the reduction of indoor triggers, nine interventions to improve the provision of health care, and five examined other interventions. Several reviews found consistent evidence of effectiveness for self-management education, and one review determined that comprehensive home-based interventions including the reduction of multiple indoor asthma triggers are effective for children. Other reviews found limited or insufficient evidence because of study limitations.
CONCLUSIONS: State or community asthma control programs should prioritize (1) implementing interventions for which the present review found evidence of effectiveness and (2) evaluating promising interventions that have not yet been adequately assessed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Population-based studies have documented an association between obesity and an increased prevalence of asthma in women.
METHODS: We prospectively studied 58 obese women with a body mass index of {\textgreater} 30 kg/m(2), 24 of whom had asthma, who were enrolled in an intensive 6-month weight loss program to determine whether loss of body mass would be correlated with improvements in bronchial reactivity, lung function, and disease-specific health status.
RESULTS: Patients lost an average of 20 kg over the 6-month period. For every 10\% relative loss of weight, the FVC improved by 92 mL (p = 0.05) and the FEV(1) improved by 73 mL (p = 0.04), however, bronchial reactivity did not significantly change with weight loss (p = 0.23). Patients who lost {\textgreater} 13\% of their pretreatment weight experienced improvements in FEV(1) (p = 0.01), FVC (p = 0.02), and total lung capacity (p = 0.05) compared to patients in the lowest quartile who failed to lose significant amounts of weight. Neither group experienced any significant change in methacholine responsiveness (p = 0.57). Patients who completed the 6-month weight loss program experienced improvements in respiratory health status, irrespective of weight loss.
CONCLUSION: We concluded that weight loss can improve lung function in obese women, however, the improvements appear to be independent of changes in airway reactivity.},

DESIGN: Open study, two randomised parallel groups.
SETTING: Private outpatients centre, Helsinki, Finland.
PARTICIPANTS: Two groups of 19 obese patients with asthma (body mass index (kg/m(2)) 30 to 42) recruited through newspaper advertisements.
INTERVENTION: Supervised weight reduction programme including 8 week very low energy diet.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body weight, morning peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)); and also asthma symptoms, number of acute episodes, courses of oral steroids, health status (quality of life).
RESULTS: At the end of the weight reducing programme, the participants in the treatment group had lost a mean of 14.5\% of their pretreatment weight, the controls 0.3\%. The corresponding figures after one year were 11.3\% and a weight gain of 2.2\%. After the 8 week dieting period the difference in changes in percentage of predicted FEV(1) from baseline in the treatment and control groups was 7.2\% (95\% confidence interval 1.9\% to 12.5\%, P=0. 009). The corresponding difference in the changes in FVC was 8.6\% (4. 8\% to 12.5\%, P{\textless}0.0001). After one year the differences in the changes in the two groups were still significant: 7.6\% for FEV(1) (1. 5\% to 13.8\%, P=0.02) and 7.6\% for FVC (3.5\% to 11.8\%, P=0.001). By the end of the weight reduction programme, reduction in dyspnoea was 13 mm (on a visual analogue scale 0 mm to 100 mm) in the treatment group and 1 mm in the control group (P=0.02). The reduction of rescue medication was 1.2 and 0.1 doses respectively (P=0.03). After one year the differences in the changes between the two groups were -12 for symptom scores (range -1 to -22, P=0.04) and -10 for total scores (-18 to -1, P=0.02). The median number of exacerbations in the treatment group was 1 (0-4) and in the controls 4 (0-7), P=0.001.

Obesity is a major health problem, and obesity is associated with a high incidence of asthma and poor asthma control. The aim of the present paper is to systematically review the current knowledge of the effect on overall asthma control of weight reduction in overweight and obese adults with asthma.

Results
Weight loss in obese individuals with doctor-diagnosed asthma is associated with a 48\%–100\% remission of asthma symptoms and use of asthma medication. Published studies, furthermore, reveal that weight loss in obese asthmatics improves asthma control, and that especially surgically induced weight loss results in significant improvements in asthma severity, use of asthma medication, dyspnoea, exercise tolerance, and acute exacerbations, including hospitalizations due to asthma. Furthermore, weight loss in obese asthmatics is associated with improvements in level of lung function and airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine, whereas no significant improvements have been observed in exhaled nitric oxide or other markers of eosinophilic airway inflammation.

Conclusion
Overweight and obese adults with asthma experience a high symptomatic remission rate and significant improvements in asthma control, including objective measures of disease activity, after weight loss. Although these positive effects of weight loss on asthma-related health outcomes seem not to be accompanied by remission or improvements in markers of eosinophilic airway inflammation, it has potentially important implications for the future burden of asthma.},

This study evaluated the financial return on investment (ROI) of the Parents of Asthmatics Quit Smoking (PAQS) program, a combined asthma education and smoking cessation intervention.
METHODS: Participants included caregivers (n = 224) that smoked, had a child with asthma, and were enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan. Participants received nurse-delivered asthma education and smoking counseling in three home visits. Program implementation costs were estimated, and healthcare expenses were obtained from insurance claims data 12 months pre- and 12 months post intervention. ROI was calculated for all participants, children {\textless}6 years, children 6-18 years, and children with moderate/severe persistent asthma.
RESULTS: Total program implementation cost was \$34,481. After intervention, there was increased mean annual refills of beta-agonist (0.51 pre, 1.64 post; P {\textless} 0.001), and controller medications (0.65 pre, 2.44 post; P {\textless} 0.001). Reductions were found in mean annual emergency department visits (0.33 pre, 0.14 post; P {\textless} 0.001), hospitalizations (0.23 pre, 0.08 post; P {\textless} 0.001), and outpatient visits (2.33 pre, 1.45 post, P {\textless} 0.001). The program had negative ROI (-21.8\%) for the entire sample. The ROI was positive (+106.9) for children {\textless}6 years, negative (-150.3) for children 6-18, and negligible for moderate/severe persistent asthma (+6.9\%).
CONCLUSION: PAQS was associated with increased medication use and decreased healthcare utilization. While the overall ROI for PAQS was negative, PAQS had a positive ROI for caregivers of young children with asthma.},

OBJECTIVE: To present the current data systematically associating use of biomass fuels with respiratory outcomes in rural women and children.
METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted in 13 electronic databases. Data were abstracted from original articles that satisfied selection criteria for meta-analyses. Publication bias and heterogeneity of samples were tested. Studies with common diagnoses were analysed using random-effect models.
RESULTS: A total of 2717 studies were identified. Fifty-one studies were selected for data extraction and 25 studies were suitable for meta-analysis. The overall pooled ORs indicate significant associations with acute respiratory infection in children (OR 3.53, 95\% CI 1.94 to 6.43), chronic bronchitis in women (OR 2.52, 95\% CI 1.88 to 3.38) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in women (OR 2.40, 95\% CI 1.47 to 3.93). In contrast, no significant association with asthma in children or women was noted.
CONCLUSION: Biomass fuel exposure is associated with diverse respiratory diseases in rural populations. Concerted efforts in improving stove design and lowering exposure to smoke emission may reduce respiratory disease associated with biomass fuel exposure.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To characterize a comprehensive comorbidity profile and to explore the economic implications of comorbidity among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed medical claims from the Maryland Medicaid database. We employed a 1:2 case-control design to select COPD patients (n=1388) and demographically matched controls (n=2776) aged 40 to 64 years with 24 months of continuous enrollment. Odds ratios were employed to compare comorbidity differences, including 17 conditions defined by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and 6 additional conditions commonly observed in COPD patients. We estimated the incremental medical utilization and medical cost by specific condition.
RESULTS: Compared with the controls, Medicaid COPD patients had higher comorbidity burden and were more likely to have myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, peptic ulcer, mild liver disease, hypertension, sleep apnea, tobacco use, and edema. COPD patients on average had 24\% more medical claims (81.4 vs. 65.4, p{\textless}0.001) and were 33\% more expensive than controls (\$7603 vs. \$5732, p{\textless}0.001). Ten conditions defined by the CCI as well as hypertension, tobacco use, and edema were associated with incremental medical utilization and cost in COPD patients; depression was associated with incremental medical utilization but not cost.
CONCLUSIONS: The high burden of comorbidity in COPD patients translates into additional medical utilization and cost. Effective disease management and treatment protocols are needed to reduce comorbidity burden. The development of a COPD-specific comorbidity measure may be used to identify high-risk subgroups and to predict utilization and cost.},

We examined how this later diagnosis may impact health care costs and utilization during the 12 months prior to and 24 months post initial CB diagnosis.
METHODS: This retrospective case-control analysis used claims data from a large US database from July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2007. Patients with CB aged 40 years and older were propensity matched (N = 11,674) to patients without evidence of COPD or asthma by demographics, CB diagnosis quarter/year, and comorbidities. Group differences were assessed using Student's t-test and Pearson chi-square test statistics.
RESULTS: Six months prediagnosis, CB patients had higher frequencies of any hospitalization (9.6\%, 6.7\%; P {\textless} 0.05), emergency department/urgent care visits (13.3\%, 6.7\%; P {\textless} 0.05), and prescriptions (97.3\%, 94.1\%; P {\textless} 0.05). Six months postdiagnosis, CB patients had 5.6 times more hospitalizations (P {\textless} 0.05) and 3.1 times more emergency department/urgent care visits (P {\textless} 0.05) compared with controls. Mean total costs (US\$) for CB patients 12 months prediagnosis were significantly higher than controls (months 12-7: \$4212, \$3826; P {\textless} 0.05; months 6-1: \$5289, \$4285; P {\textless} 0.05). CB patients had higher mean total costs (\$8919; P {\textless} 0.05) 6 months postdiagnosis. Costs remained \$2429 higher for CB patients 19-24 months postdiagnosis (P {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Health care costs and utilization among CB patients are increased both prior to diagnosis and during the 2 years postdiagnosis. This study suggests that not accurately diagnosing CB early has a substantial impact on health care costs, and that the economic burden for CB patients remains elevated even after adjustment for comorbidities associated with COPD.},

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Acute-care hospital in Barcelona (Spain).
PATIENTS: One hundred thirty-five consecutive patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of COPD, between October 1996 and May 1997.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Clinical, spirometric, and gasometric variables were evaluated at the time of inclusion in the study. Socioeconomic characteristics, comorbidity, dyspnea, functional status, depression, and quality of life were analyzed. Mortality at 180 days, 1 year, and 2 years was 13.4\%, 22\%, and 35.6\%, respectively. Sixty-four patients (47.4\%) were dead at the end of the study (median follow-up duration, 838 days). Greater mortality was observed in the bivariate analysis among the oldest patients (p {\textless} 0.0001), women (p {\textless} 0.01), and unmarried patients (p {\textless} 0.002). Hospital admission during the previous year (p {\textless} 0.001), functional dependence (Katz index) [p {\textless} 0.0004], greater comorbidity (Charlson index) [p {\textless} 0.0006], depression (Yesavage Scale) [p {\textless} 0.00001]), quality of life (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]) [p {\textless} 0.01], and PCO(2) at discharge (p {\textless} 0.03) were also among the significant predictors of mortality.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most deadly, prevalent, and costly chronic diseases, no comprehensive estimates of the risk of developing COPD in the general population have been published. We aimed to quantify the lifetime risk of developing physician-diagnosed COPD in a large, multicultural North American population.
METHODS: We did a retrospective longitudinal cohort study using population-based health administrative data from Ontario, Canada (total population roughly 13 million). All individuals free of COPD in 1996 were monitored for up to 14 years for three possible outcomes; diagnosis of COPD by a physician, reached 80 years of age, or death. COPD was identified with a previously validated case definition based on COPD health services claims. The cumulative incidence of physician-diagnosed COPD over a lifetime adjusted for the competing risk of death was calculated by a modified survival analysis technique. Results were stratified by sex, socioeconomic status, and whether individuals lived in a rural or urban setting.
FINDINGS: A total of 579,466 individuals were diagnosed with COPD by a physician over the study period. The overall lifetime risk of physician-diagnosed COPD at age 80 years was 27·6\%. Lifetime risk was higher in men than in women (29·7\%vs 25·6\%), individuals of lower socioeconomic status than in those of higher socioeconomic status (32·1\%vs 23·0\%), and individuals who lived in a rural setting than in those who lived in an urban setting (32·4\%vs 26·7\%).
INTERPRETATION: About one in four individuals are likely to be diagnosed and receive medical attention for COPD during their lifetime. Clinical evidence-based approaches, public health action, and more research are needed to identify effective strategies to prevent COPD and ensure that those with the disease have the highest quality of life possible.

It is a global health issue, with cigarette smoking being an important risk factor universally; other factors, such as exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution, occupational hazards, and infections, are also important. As the global population ages, the burden of COPD will increase in years to come. Prevalence estimates of the disorder show considerable variability across populations, suggesting that risk factors can affect populations differently. Other advances in our understanding of COPD are increased recognition of the importance of comorbid disease, identification of different COPD phenotypes, and understanding how factors other than lung function affect outcome in our patients. The challenge we will all face in the next few years will be implementation of cost-effective prevention and management strategies to stem the tide of this disease and its cost.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nowadays, there is increasing awareness about the frequent chronic comorbidities in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but little information is available to quantify the burden of illness that these conditions cause in this population. We aimed to identify and describe a population suffering from COPD highlighting the co-morbid conditions that may contribute to poor clinical outcomes.
DESIGN: Epidemiological cross-sectional study conducted using administrative heath services databases.
RESULTS: A cohort of 126,283 COPD patients was identified. The estimated prevalence in adult population was 3.6\%. Ninety-eight percent of these patients (123,603) received at least one prescription of "non-respiratory drugs" and, considering chronic specific comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, diabetes and depression) 86,351 patients (68.4\% of COPD patients) suffered from at least one of these conditions. 80,840 pts (64.4\%) were treated for cardiovascular diseases, 17,091 subjects for diabetes (12.4\%) and 10,292 for depression (8\%). About 16\% of COPD subjects (19,168 patients) had two out of the three considered comorbid conditions and 1352 patients (1.1\%) all three.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the complex spectrum of comorbidities in COPD patients. The prevalence of main chronic diseases increases with age, in particular among female group. An enhanced public awareness about these conditions is necessary, just as a more comprehensive approach in their management.},

Few studies have analysed the role of reduced lung function in predicting atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and risk of first episode of AF in a prospective study. Data from 13,430 males and females without previous myocardial infarction, who participated in the Copenhagen City Heart Study, were analysed. New AF was assessed at re-examination after 5 yrs and by hospital admission for AF during a period of 13 yrs. Multivariate analyses were used with adjustment for cardiopulmonary risk factors. There were 62 new cases of AF at 5-yr follow-up (0.58\%) and 290 cases (2.20\%) diagnosed at hospitalisations. Risk of new AF at re-examination was 1.8-times higher for FEV1 between 60-80\% of predicted compared with FEV1 {\textgreater} or = 80\% after adjustment for sex, age, smoking, blood pressure, diabetes and body mass index. The risk of AF hospitalisation was 1.3-times higher for FEV1 between 60-80\% and 1.8-times higher for FEV1 {\textless} 60\% compared with FEV1 {\textgreater} or = 80\%, when additional adjustment was made for education, treatment with diuretics and chest pain at activity.

	abstract = {Many analyses of healthcare costs involve use of data with varying periods of observation and right censoring of cases before death or at the end of the episode of illness. The prominence of observations with no expenditure for some short periods of observation and the extreme skewness typical of these data raise concerns about the robustness of estimators based on inverse probability weighting (IPW) with the survival from censoring probabilities. These estimators also cannot distinguish between the effects of covariates on survival and intensity of utilization, which jointly determine costs. In this paper, we propose a new estimator that extends the class of two-part models to deal with random right censoring and for continuous death and censoring times. Our model also addresses issues about the time to death in these analyses and separates the survival effects from the intensity effects. Using simulations, we compare our proposed estimator to the inverse probability estimator, which shows bias when censoring is large and covariates affect survival. We find our estimator to be unbiased and also more efficient for these designs. We apply our method and compare it with the IPW method using data from the Medicare-SEER files on prostate cancer.},

To assess the effects of depressive symptoms on asthma patients' reports of functional status and health-related quality of life.

DESIGN
Cross-sectional study.

SETTING
Primary care internal medicine practice at a tertiary care center in New York City.

PATIENTS
We studied 230 outpatients between the ages of 18 and 62 years with moderate asthma.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS
Patients were interviewed in person in English or Spanish with two health-related quality-of-life measures, the disease-specific Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) (possible score range, 1 to 7; higher scores reflect better function) and the generic Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 (general population mean is 50 for both the Physical Component Summary [PCS] score and Mental Component Summary [MCS] score). Patients also completed a screen for depressive symptoms, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and a global question regarding current disease activity. Stepwise multivariate analyses were conducted with the AQLQ and SF-36 scores as the dependent variables and depressive symptoms, comorbidity, asthma, and demographic characteristics as independent variables. The mean age of patients was 41 ±SD 11 years and 83\% were women. The mean GDS score was 11 ±SD 8 (possible range, 0 to 30; higher scores reflect more depressive symptoms), and a large percentage of patients, 45\%, scored above the threshold considered positive for depression screening. Compared with patients with a negative screen for depressive symptoms, patients with a positive screen had worse composite AQLQ scores (3.9 ±SD 1.3 vs 2.8 ±SD 0.8, P {\textless} .0001) and worse PCS scores (40 ±SD 11 vs 34 ±SD 8, P {\textless} .0001) and worse MCS scores (48 ±SD 11 vs 32 ±SD 10, P {\textless} .0001) scores. In stepwise analyses, current asthma activity and GDS scores had the greatest effects on patient-reported health-related quality of life, accounting for 36\% and 11\% of the variance, respectively, for the composite AQLQ, and 11\% and 38\% of the variance, respectively, for the MCS in multivariate analyses.

CONCLUSIONS
Nearly half of asthma patients in this study had a positive screen for depressive symptoms. Asthma patients with more depressive symptoms reported worse health-related quality of life than asthma patients with similar disease activity but fewer depressive symptoms. Given the new emphasis on functional status and health-related quality of life measured by disease-specific and general health scales, we conclude that psychological status indicators should also be considered when patient-derived measures are used to assess outcomes in asthma.},

	abstract = {Background The EQ-5D is a preference based instrument which provides a description of a respondent's health status, and an empirically derived value for that health state often from a representative sample of the general population. It is commonly used to derive Quality Adjusted Life Year calculations (QALY) in economic evaluations. However, values for health states have been found to differ between countries. The objective of this study was to develop a set of values for the EQ-5D health states for use in Canada. Methods Values for 48 different EQ-5D health states were elicited using the Time Trade Off (TTO) via a web survey in English. A random effect model was fitted to the data to estimate values for all 243 health states of the EQ-5D. Various model specifications were explored. Comparisons with EQ-5D values from the UK and US were made. Sensitivity analysis explored different transformations of values worse than dead, and exclusion criteria of subjects. Results The final model was estimated from the values of 1145 subjects with socio-demographics broadly representative of Canadian general population with the exception of Quebec. This yielded a good fit with observed TTO values, with an overall R2 of 0.403 and a mean absolute error of 0.044. Conclusion A preference-weight algorithm for Canadian studies that include the EQ-5D is developed. The primary limitations regarded the representativeness of the final sample, given the language used (English only), the method of recruitment, and the difficulty in the task. Insights into potential issues for conducting valuation studies in countries as large and diverse as Canada are gained.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We sought to compare directly elicited valuations for EQ-5D health states between the US and UK general adult populations.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 2 EQ-5D valuation studies where, using similar time trade-off protocols, values for 42 common health states were elicited from representative samples of the US and UK general adult populations. First, US and UK population mean valuations were estimated and compared for each health state. Second, random-effect models were used to compare the US and UK valuations while adjusting for known predictors of EQ-5D valuations (ie, age, sex, health state descriptors) and to investigate whether and how the valuations differ.
RESULTS: Population mean valuations of the 42 health states ranged from -0.38 to 0.88 for the United States and from -0.54 to 0.88 for the United Kingdom, with the US mean scores being numerically higher than the UK for 39 health states (mean difference: 0.11; range: -0.01 to 0.25). After adjusting for the main effects of known predictors, the average difference in valuations was 0.10 (P {\textless} 0.001). The magnitude of the difference in the US and UK valuations was not constant across EQ-5D health states; greater differences in valuations were present in health states characterized by extreme problems.
CONCLUSIONS: Meaningful differences exist in directly elicited TTO valuations of EQ-5D health states between the US and UK general populations. Therefore, EQ-5D index scores generated using valuations from the US general population should be used for studies aiming to reflect health state preferences of the US general public.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The search for a reliable, valid and cost-effective comorbidity risk adjustment method for outcomes research continues to be a challenge. The most widely used tool, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is limited due to frequent missing data in medical records and administrative data. Patient self-report data has the potential to be more complete but has not been widely used. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire (SCQ) to predict functional capacity, quality of life (QOL) health outcomes compared to CCI medical records data.
METHOD: An SCQ-score was generated from patient interview, and the CCI score was generated by medical record review for 525 patients hospitalized for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) at baseline, three months and eight months post-discharge. Linear regression models assessed the extent to which there were differences in the ability of comorbidity measures to predict functional capacity (Activity Status Index [ASI] scores) and quality of life (EuroQOL 5D [EQ5D] scores).
RESULTS: The CCI (R2 = 0.245; p = 0.132) did not predict quality of life scores while the SCQ self-report method (R2 = 0.265; p {\textless} 0.0005) predicted the EQ5D scores. However, the CCI was almost as good as the SCQ for predicting the ASI scores at three and six months and performed slightly better in predicting ASI at eight-month follow up (R2 = 0.370; p {\textless} 0.0005 vs. R2 = 0.358; p {\textless} 0.0005) respectively. Only age, gender, family income and Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CESD) scores showed significant association with both measures in predicting QOL and functional capacity.
CONCLUSIONS: Although our model R-squares were fairly low, these results show that the self-report SCQ index is a good alternative method to predict QOL health outcomes when compared to a CCI medical record score. Both measures predicted physical functioning similarly. This suggests that patient self-reported comorbidity data can be used for predicting physical functional capacity and QOL and can serve as a reliable risk adjustment measure. Self-report comorbidity data may provide a cost-effective alternative method for risk adjustment in clinical research, health policy and organizational improvement analyses.

RESULTS: The CCI (R2 = 0.245; p = 0.132) did not predict quality of life scores while the SCQ self-report method (R2 = 0.265; p {\textless} 0.0005) predicted the EQ5D scores. However, the CCI was almost as good as the SCQ for predicting the ASI scores at three and six months and performed slightly better in predicting ASI at eight-month follow up (R2 = 0.370; p {\textless} 0.0005 vs. R2 = 0.358; p {\textless} 0.0005) respectively. Only age, gender, family income and Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CESD) scores showed significant association with both measures in predicting QOL and functional capacity.
CONCLUSIONS: Although our model R-squares were fairly low, these results show that the self-report SCQ index is a good alternative method to predict QOL health outcomes when compared to a CCI medical record score. Both measures predicted physical functioning similarly. This suggests that patient self-reported comorbidity data can be used for predicting physical functional capacity and QOL and can serve as a reliable risk adjustment measure. Self-report comorbidity data may provide a cost-effective alternative method for risk adjustment in clinical research, health policy and organizational improvement analyses.

	abstract = {Co-existent or comorbid diseases are appreciated as prognostic factors in studies of quality and effectiveness of care when mortality is the end point. The need to measure and adjust for comorbidity in studies of postoperative hospital complications or long-term recovery from surgery has not been documented. In this study, we determined the impact of co-existent disease on post-operative complications and 1-year health-related quality of life in patients hospitalized for a total hip replacement. The study population consisted of a cohort of 356 patients who were hospitalized in four teaching hospitals in California and Massachusetts for a total hip replacement. Patients' medical records were reviewed to collect information regarding severity of illness, co-existent disease, and postoperative complications. The kind and amount of baseline preoperative co-existent disease was measured from medical record information at admission using a four level Index of co-existent Disease (ICED). Approximately 12 months after hospital discharge, 283 (80\%) of the patients were surveyed by questionnaire. The presence and amount of co-existent disease were significant predictors of postoperative complications. The complication rates ranged from 3\% to 41\% between the lowest and highest levels of the ICED. Patients treated at the four study hospitals differed in functional outcomes 1 year after surgery. Functional outcomes were strongly related to ICED scores: patients in Level 4 ICED scored 26.8 points lower in instrumental activities of daily living than patients in Level 1. After controlling for gender, age, education, and marital status, ICED remained a significant predictor of functional status at 1 year. Furthermore, differences among hospitals in functional outcomes disappeared when the ICED was included in the model to adjust for patient characteristics at the time of surgery. A measure of co-existent disease was crucial in explaining differences among hospitals in recovery from total hip replacement patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to validate an instrument measuring the clinical burden of several medical problems in the same patient (multimorbidity), in a family practice context and, more specifically, to verify if trained nurses can score the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) from chart review.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A convenience sample of 40 patients was selected. The attending physicians scored the CIRS during clinical interview (CIRS-MD/I), then three nurses scored the CIRS during clinical interview (CIRS-NUR/I) and three other nurses scored the CIRS from chart review (CIRS-NUR/C) (interrater reliability). Two of these nurses scored the CIRS-NUR/C again 2 months later (intrarater reliability).
RESULTS: For interrater reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.81 (0.70-0.89) for the CIRS-NUR/I and 0.78 (0.66-0.87) for the CIRS-NUR/C. The intrarater reliability of the CIRS-NUR/C was 0.89 (0.80-0.94) for one of the nurses and 0.80 (0.65-0.89) for the other. Concomitant validity of these two forms of CIRS with the CIRS-MD/I ranged from 0.73 to 0.84.
CONCLUSION: The CIRS appears to be a reliable and valid instrument in a primary care context and trained nurses can score the CIRS from chart review.},

	abstract = {Recurrent exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity and medical expenditure in patients with asthma. Various exogenous and endogenous factors are thought to influence the level of asthma control, but systematical data on the involvement of these factors in the recurrence of asthma exacerbations are scarce. In this study, 13 clinical and environmental factors potentially associated with recurrent exacerbations were investigated in 136 patients with difficult-to-treat asthma. Patients with more than three severe exacerbations (n = 39) in the previous year were compared with those with only one exacerbation per year (n = 24). A systematic diagnostic protocol was used to assess 13 potential risk factors. Factors significantly associated with frequent exacerbations included: severe nasal sinus disease (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.7); gastro-oesophageal reflux (OR 4.9); recurrent respiratory infections (OR 6.9); psychological dysfunctioning (OR 10.8); and obstructive sleep apnoea (OR 3.4). Severe chronic sinus disease and psychological dysfunctioning were the only independently associated factors (adjusted OR 5.5 and 11.7, respectively). All patients with frequent exacerbations exhibited at least one of these five factors, whilst 52\% showed three or more factors. In conclusion, the results show that recurrent exacerbations in asthma are associated with specific co-morbid factors that are easy to detect and that are treatable. Therapeutic interventions aimed at correcting these factors are likely to reduce morbidity and medical expenditure in these patients.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The quality of life (QOL) in persons with asthma is reduced and different factors such as demography, asthma severity and psychiatric comorbidity play an influential role. However, little is known about the interplay of these factors.
OBJECTIVE: To describe QOL in relation to asthma and analyse for the relative impact of asthma severity, psychiatric comorbidity, lifestyle (smoking and obesity) and demographic determinants on QOL in persons with asthma.
METHODS: One thousand one hundred sixty-one subjects from an earlier cohort with and without asthma were sent an asthma screening questionnaire and a generic QOL measuring instrument (15D).
RESULTS: Seven hundred seventy-eight valid responses (67\%). QOL was significantly reduced in persons with asthma compared with controls (P = 0.001), almost on all domains of 15D. In the adjusted regression model, asthma severity, depression, female gender and smoking were associated with reduced QOL, suggesting that these factors play an independent role on lowering QOL. Depression did not inflate the relationship between asthma severity and worse QOL, suggesting that asthma severity plays an independent role on everyday life regardless of psychological state.
CONCLUSION: Asthma severity, psychiatric comorbidity, female gender and smoking were identified in this study to be major contributors to decreased QOL in asthmatics. Health professionals should be aware of this complex picture and take these factors into consideration when choosing the proper treatment of asthma patients.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There are limited data on the association and interaction between anxiety and depression comorbidity and asthma-related quality of life (AQOL) and symptom perception. This study evaluated these associations in patients subsequent to an emergency department (ED) visit for asthma.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 110 (38 male) adult asthma patients (mean age 42 years), who had visited an ED in the previous 18 months. Participants completed the hospital anxiety and depression scale, measures of AQOL and the asthma symptom checklist.
RESULTS: Depression symptoms independently showed a significant negative association with AQOL after controlling for depression/anxiety, age, gender, smoking status and ED visits in the previous 12 months (ED-12). Overall, anxiety and depression symptoms accounted for 28.3\% of the variance in AQOL. Greater anxiety was associated with increased perception of asthma-specific panic-fear and hyperventilation symptoms during an asthma attack, irrespective of depression status. Categorical analyses of groups of patients, differentiated by psychometric properties on the hospital anxiety and depression scale (anxiety vs normal, anxiety and depression vs normal depression) confirmed most results. However, for the anxiety group there was a significant association with the AQOL domains of emotional functioning and response to environmental stimuli, after controlling for depression symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The negative association of depression symptom scores with AQOL and of anxiety with increased panic-fear and hyperventilation symptoms suggests a potential role for interventions addressing this psychological comorbidity, in order to improve AQOL.},

The primary aim of this study is to ascertain whether comorbidity id more common in uncontrolled patients. As a secondary aim, we propose to evaluate the correlation between the asthma control test (ACT) and the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO).
PATIENT AND METHODS: A prospective, observational study comparing the function and clinical picture of two groups of asthmatics: controlled (ACT≥20) and uncontrolled (ACT{\textless}20). They were all assessed for, smoking, rhinosinusitis, obesity, anxiety, depression, vocal cord dysfunction, gastro-oesophageal reflux (GORD), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), COPD and nasal polyps.
RESULTS: A total of 50 patients with controlled asthma and 102 with suboptimal control were included. The patients with an ACT≥20 had better lung function, less variation in PEF, less bronchial hyper-reactivity and lower FENO values. Comorbidities were found in 95\% of the controlled asthmatics and in 97\% of the uncontrolled. Only the presence of nasal polyps, GORD and ABPA was more frequent in the uncontrolled group. However, the simultaneous presence of 3 or more comorbidity factors was significantly more frequent in patients with sub-optimal control (P=0.01). There was no significant correlation between the FENO and the ACT values (rho=-0.08; P=0.32).
CONCLUSIONS: Aggravating comorbidities are more common in patients with sub-optimal control. There was no correlation between the FENO and the ACT values.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article summarizes the more common comorbidities which, in the opinion of the authors and supported by the medical literature, frequently affect asthma management. Optimal asthma control requires accurate diagnosis, implementation of effective therapy, and evaluation of coexisting conditions. Comorbidities refer to either coexisting conditions or interacting conditions, with the latter having a more significant influence on the management of asthma. This review provides the authors' clinical perspective of the more common comorbidities and relevant literature reviewed primarily from the past 4-5 years.
RECENT FINDINGS: Optimizing rhinitis and rhinosinusitis management and addressing allergic sensitivity and allergen exposure are achievable measures for the most common asthma comorbidity. Psychological dysfunction and paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction are frequently associated with poor asthma control. The effects of obesity are inconsistent in the literature but obesity likely affects asthma symptoms and possibly its pathogenesis. Treatment of asymptomatic gastroesophageal reflux does not improve asthma.
SUMMARY: Asthma is a common disease and other conditions frequently occur concomitantly in individuals with asthma. Asthma is usually very treatable and comorbidities should be considered and addressed or the asthma diagnosis questioned if treatment effects are not optimal. Evidence-based medicine is lacking as most asthma studies exclude comorbidities; additional studies are needed.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: There is increasing interest in the frequency and nature of comorbidities in patients with obstructive lung disease: COPD and asthma. We aimed to quantify baseline rates of comorbidities in COPD and asthma patients and to compare the risks to the general population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Within the UK General Practice Research Database, we compared incident patients with COPD (n = 2,699) and asthma (n = 7,931) physician diagnosed in 1998 with age, gender, time, and practice-matched cohorts. Rates were calculated and relative risks (RRs) were estimated for comorbidities in major organ systems and selected medical events of a priori interest.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: In both COPD and asthma, the total sum of diagnoses related to major organ systems was higher than in their matched population controls. Among incident COPD patients, a frequency {\textgreater} 1\% within the first year after diagnosis was observed for angina, cataracts, bone fractures, osteoporosis, pneumonia, and respiratory infections, the highest being angina with 4.0\%. Compared to the non-COPD cohort, COPD patients were at increased risk for pneumonia (relative risk [RR] = 16.0), osteoporosis (RR = 3.1), respiratory infection (RR = 2.2), myocardial infarction (RR = 1.7), angina (RR = 1.7), fractures (RR = 1.6), and glaucoma (RR = 1.3) [all p {\textless} 0.05]. Of note, 2.0\% of COPD patients had cataracts recorded, but this rate was no different than that of the non-COPD cohort (RR = 0.9). Among incident asthma patients, the occurrence of events was generally lower, likely due to the younger age distribution, except for 4.0\% with respiratory infection (RR = 1.84) and 1.7\% with fractures (RR = 1.5). Angina prevalence was 0.7\% in the asthma cohort and 1.4 times more common than in patients without asthma.
CONCLUSION: COPD and asthma are conditions associated with many comorbidities, albeit asthma to a lesser extent than COPD, which had not been systematically reviewed before. Baseline rates of cardiovascular-, bone-, and other smoking-related conditions are high.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current asthma management guidelines are based on the level of asthma control. The impact of asthma control on health care resources and quality of life (QoL) is insufficiently studied. EUCOAST study was designed to describe costs and QoL in adult patients according to level of asthma control in France and Spain.
METHODS: An observational cost of illness study was conducted simultaneously in both countries among patients age greater or equal to 18 with a diagnosis of asthma for at least 12 months. Patients were recruited prospectively by GPs in 2010 in four waves to avoid a seasonal bias. Health care resources utilization of the three months before the inclusion was collected through physician questionnaires. Asthma control was evaluated using 2009 GINA criteria over a 3-month period. QoL was assessed using EQ-5D-3L®.
RESULTS: 2,671 patients (France: 1,154; Spain: 1,517) were enrolled. Asthma was controlled in 40.6\% [95\% CI: 37.7\%-43.4\%] and 29.9\% [95\% CI: 27.6\%-32.3\%] of French and Spanish patients respectively.For all types of costs, the percentage of patients using health care resources varied significantly according to the level of asthma control. The average cost (euros/3-months/patient) of controlled asthma was €85.4 (SD: 153.5) in France compared with €314.0 (SD: 2,160.4) for partially controlled asthma and €537.9 (SD: 2,355.7) for uncontrolled asthma (p{\textless}0.0001). In Spain, the corresponding figures were €152.6 (SD: 162.1), €241.2 (SD: 266.8), and €556.8 (SD: 762.4). EQ-5D-3L® score was higher (p{\textless}0.0001) in patients with controlled asthma compared to partially controlled and uncontrolled asthma in both countries (respectively 0.88; 0.78; 0.63 in France and 0.89; 0.82; 0.69 in Spain).

However, it is unclear whether HRQL instruments can discriminate across asthma control measures. The objective of this study was to evaluate the validity of generic and condition-specific preference-based instruments, in terms of their ability to distinguish asthma control.
METHODS: Asthma patients (n = 157) completed three generic preference-based instruments: the Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI-3), the EuroQol (EQ-5D), and the Short Form 6D (SF-6D) and two condition-specific questionnaires: the standardized Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ(S)) and the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ). The AQLQ(S) scores were converted into the condition-specific preference-based scores: the Asthma Quality of Life Utility Index (AQL-5D).
RESULTS: The preference-based instruments were generally able to discriminate across control measures, such as ACQ scores and magnitude of asthma medication, but were not able to discriminate for self-reported control and severity levels. These instruments also correlated with most control measures (r = 0.32-0.37). Significant relationships between AQL-5D scores and all control variables were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the AQL-5D discriminated across all levels of asthma control. The HUI-3, the EQ-5D, and the SF-6D differentiated between the highest and lowest levels of control but could not discriminate between the moderate levels.},

Good correlation is reported between a composite evaluation of asthma control (the Asthma Control Test [ACT]) and QoL, with emphasis on asthma as a frequent cause of chronic cough and worsening of QoL due to chronic cough.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate asthma control in real life and to evaluate chronic cough-related impairment of QoL in patients with different degrees of asthma control evaluated by the ACT.
METHODS: Outpatients awaiting physician visits for asthma evaluation were asked to complete the ACT, the Chronic Cough Impact Questionnaire (CCIQ), and a rhinitis symptom score (Total Symptom Score [TSS] 5).
RESULTS: A total of 122 patients (mean [SD] age, 44 [15] years; age range, 15-75 years; 61.5\% female) were enrolled in the study, of whom 74\% reported rhinitis in conjunction with asthma. Overall asthma control was substantially less than optimal (ACT mean score, 14) in 44\% of patients. Asthma control correlated to a limited degree with the CCIQ among the total sample. In patients with asthma alone, the correlation between the ACT and the CCIQ was much improved. In patients with comorbid rhinitis, only those with significant symptoms (as determined by the TSS5) reported using rhinitis treatment; among these, no significant correlation between the ACT and the CCIQ was found.
CONCLUSIONS: Asthma control in real life is less than optimal in substantially few patients. The importance of cough in asthma is highlighted by good correlation between cough and the ACT score in patients without comorbid rhinitis. In patients with comorbid rhinitis, cough appears related more to rhinitis than to asthma control. The combined use of the ACT and the CCIQ may be useful to improve asthma management, especially among patients in whom cough remains a prominent symptom.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Common measures of adherence to prescribed medications derived from administrative databases reflect both patients' and physicians' behavior, even if the measures are often interpreted as reflecting only the patient's adherence. Adherence to inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) has been shown to be low among patients with asthma.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a new measure of patients' adherence adjusted for prescription patterns and to evaluate the extent to which the low use of ICSs in asthma is due to patients' nonadherence or suboptimal prescribing practices.
METHODS: The new measure of adherence, called the proportion of prescribed days covered (PPDC), is defined as the ratio of the total days' supply dispensed to the total days' supply prescribed during the study period. The PPDC is a modification of an existing adherence measure, the proportion of days covered (PDC). The PPDC and PDC for ICSs, therapy that should be prescribed for chronic daily use to patients with persistent asthma, were compared within a cohort of 4190 ICS-naïve patients with asthma aged 18-45 years derived from the administrative health databases of Quebec, Canada. We estimated the mean and the 95\% confidence interval of the PPDC and PDC for ICSs over 1 year, and we calculated the part of nonadherence attributed to patients when measured with the PDC that can be attributed to nonoptimal prescribing of ICSs for chronic daily use with the following formula: [(1-PDC)-(1-PPDC)]/(1-PDC).
RESULTS: The mean PPDC and PDC during the 1-year study were 52.6\% (95\% CI 51.6 to 53.6) and 19.1\% (95\% CI 18.6 to 19.6), respectively. Forty-one percent of nonadherence attributed to patients when measured with the PDC could be, in fact, attributed to nonprescribing of ICSs for chronic daily use.
CONCLUSIONS: Our new adherence measure, the PPDC, may be considered as another way to assess patient adherence, taking into account differing prescribing patterns.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop the Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire (SCQ) and assess its psychometric properties, including the predictive validity of the instrument, as reflected by its association with health status and health care utilization after 1 year.
METHODS: A cross-sectional comparison of the SCQ with a standard, chart abstraction-based measure (Charlson Index) was conducted on 170 inpatients from medical and surgical care units. The association of the SCQ with the chart-based comorbidity instrument and health status (short form 36) was evaluated cross sectionally. The association between these measures and health status and resource utilization was assessed after 1 year.
RESULTS: The Spearman correlation coefficient for the association between the SCQ and the Charlson Index was 0.32. After restricting each measure to include only comparable items, the correlation between measures was stronger (Spearman r = 0.55). The SCQ had modest associations with measures of resource utilization during the index admission, and with health status and resource utilization after 1 year.
CONCLUSION: The SCQ has modest correlations with a widely used medical record-based comorbidity instrument, and with subsequent health status and utilization. This new measure represents an efficient method to assess comorbid conditions in clinical and health services research. It will be particularly useful in settings where medical records are unavailable.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This article presents a valuation study to estimate a preference-based index for a 5-dimensional health state classification for asthma (AQL-5D) derived from the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ).
METHODS: A sample of 307 members of the UK general population valued 99 asthma health states selected from the AQL-5D using the time tradeoff technique. Models were estimated to predict all possible 3125 health states defined by the AQL-5D, and the models were compared in terms of their ability to predict mean values for the 99 states.
RESULTS: Mean health state values ranged from 0.39 to 0.94 based on an average of 22 valuations per state. A main effects model estimated on mean health state values and adjusted for consistency had the best predictive ability (mean absolute error of 0.047 and only 9/98 states with errors {\textgreater}0.1) and the most logical consistency with levels of the AQL-5D. The low number of valuations per state may have resulted in unreliable estimates for the models. Preference-based condition specific measures are limited in their ability to make cross-disease comparisons.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to derive a condition-specific preference-based measure from an existing measure of health-related quality of life in asthma for use in economic evaluation.},

This paper reports on a large-scale national study that elicited the relative valuations attached by the general public to different states of health (defined in HRQoL terms). Health state valuations were derived using the time trade-off (TTO) method. The data from 3395 respondents were highly consistent, suggesting that it is feasible to use the TTO method to elicit valuations from the general public. The paper shows that valuations for severe health states appear to be affected by the age and the sex of the respondent; those aged 18-59 have higher valuations than those aged 60 or over and men have higher valuations than women. These results contradict those reported elsewhere and suggest that the small samples used in other studies may be concealing real differences that exist between population sub-groups.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Many patients with asthma spend time and resources consuming complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs). This study explores whether CAM utilisation is associated with asthma control and the intake of asthma controller medications.
DESIGN: Population-based, prospective cross-sectional study.
SETTING: General population residing in two census areas in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Recruitment was based on random-digit dialling of both landlines and cell phones.
PARTICIPANTS: 486 patients with self-reported physician diagnosis of asthma (mean age 52 years; 67.3\% woman).
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed CAM use over the previous 12 months, level of asthma control as defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma and the self-reported intake of controller medications. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to study the relationship between any usage of CAMs (outcome), asthma control and controller medication usage, adjusted for potential confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 179 (36.8\%) of the sample reported CAM usage in the past 12 months. Breathing exercises (17.7\%), herbal medicines (10.1\%) and vitamins (9.7\%) were the most popular CAMs reported. After adjustment, female sex (OR 1.66; 95\% CI 1.09 to 2.52) and uncontrolled asthma (vs controlled asthma, OR 2.25, 95\% CI 1.30 to 3.89) were associated with a higher likelihood of using any CAMs in the past 12 months. Controller medication use was not associated with CAM usage in general and in the subgroups defined by asthma control.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and policy makers need to be aware of the high prevalence of CAM use in patients with asthma and its association with lack of asthma control.},

The resulting estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal with easily estimated variance–covariance matrices. The proposed methodology can be used when the cost database contains only the total costs for those with complete follow-up. More efficient estimators are available when the cost data are recorded in multiple time intervals. A study on the medical cost for ovarian cancer is presented.},

The authors first examined whether lower socioeconomic groups use more health services, as would be expected given their poorer health status. They then investigated to what extent differential use of health services modifies socioeconomic disparities in mortality. Finally, the authors evaluated health services use in the last years of life when health is poor regardless of a person's socioeconomic background. , Setting: The Canadian province of Nova Scotia, which provides universal health care coverage to all residents. , Participants: 1816 non-institutionalised adults, aged 18–75 years, from a two stage cluster sample stratified by age, gender, and region. , Main results: People with lower socioeconomic background used comparatively more family physician and hospital services, in such a way as to ameliorate the socioeconomic differences in mortality. In contrast, specialist services were comparatively underused by people in lower socioeconomic groups. In the last three years of life, use of specialist services was significantly higher in the highest income group. , Conclusions: Universal coverage of family physician and hospital services ameliorate the socioeconomic differences in mortality. However, specialist services are underused in lower socioeconomic groups, bearing the potential to widen the socioeconomic gap in health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lack of an association between area-based socioeconomic status (SES) and readmission for asthma was investigated in a country with a universal health care system.
METHODS: Data linkage analysis was conducted based on hospitalization data from Statistics Canada's Person-oriented Information Database and area-based SES data from the 1996 Census. Hospital records for 8333 asthma patients aged 20-64 years in all Canadian provinces except Quebec who were admitted in 1995/1996 were linked to determine the number of patients who were rehospitalized within the same fiscal year. The area-based SES of the patients was defined according to the average personal income and proportion of residents with a university degree in an enumeration area (EA). Incidence rates of readmission for asthma were calculated based on the total years at risk. Cox's proportional hazard model was used to adjust for age, sex, province, and length of stay for first admission.
RESULTS: The incidence rate of asthma rehospitalization was 31.6 per 100 person-years for men and 37.2 per 100 person-years for women. Neither average EA income or education level was significantly associated with rehospitalization for asthma. Women living in poor areas tended to have an increased incidence of asthma rehospitalization, but the difference was not significant after adjustment for covariates using the Cox regression model.
CONCLUSION: Socioeconomic status measured at the neighborhood level has no significant impact on rehospitalization for asthma among Canadian adults.},

	abstract = {Background: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) constitute the cornerstone of treatment for asthma. Many studies have reported beneficial short term effects of these drugs, but there are few data on the long term effects of ICS on the decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). This study was undertaken to determine whether adults with asthma treated with ICS have a less pronounced decline in FEV1 than those not treated with ICS.
Methods: Two hundred and thirty four asthmatic individuals from a longitudinal epidemiological study of the general population of Copenhagen, Denmark were divided into two groups; 44 were treated with ICS and 190 were not treated with ICS. The annual decline in FEV1 was measured over a 10 year follow up period.
Results: The decline in FEV1 in the 44 patients receiving ICS was 25 ml/year compared with 51 ml/year in the 190 patients not receiving this treatment (p{\textless}0.001). The linear regression model with ICS as the variable of interest and sex, smoking, and wheezing as covariates showed that treatment with ICS was associated with a less steep decline in FEV1 of 18 ml/year (p = 0.01). Adjustment for additional variables including age, socioeconomic status, body mass index, mucus hypersecretion, and use of other asthma medications did not change these results.
Conclusions: Treatment with ICS is associated with a significantly reduced decline in ventilatory function.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are many scores for the evaluation of asthma. However, most do not take into account the evolutionary aspects of this illness. We propose a model for the clinical course of asthma by a homogeneous Markov model process based on data provided by the A.R.I.A. (Association de Recherche en Intelligence Artificielle dans le cadre de l'asthme et des maladies respiratoires).
METHODS: The criterion used is the activity of the illness during the month before consultation. The activity is divided into three levels: light (state 1), mild (state 2) and severe (state 3). The model allows the evaluation of the strength of transition between states.
RESULTS: We found that strong intensities were implicated towards state 2 (lambda(12) and lambda(32)), less towards state 1 (lambda(21) and lambda(31)), and minimum towards state 3 (lambda(23)). This results in an equilibrium distribution essentially divided between state 1 and 2 (44.6\% and 51.0\% respectively) with a small proportion in state 3 (4.4\%).
CONCLUSIONS: In the future, the increasing amount of available data should permit the introduction of covariables, the distinction of subgroups and the implementation of clinical studies. The interest of this model falls within the domain of the quantification of the illness as well as the representation allowed thereof, while offering a formal framework for the clinical notion of time and evolution.},

	doi = {10.1097/MLR.0b013e31829a4fb4},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have found that increased hospital or surgeon operative volumes, as measured by the number of procedures performed, are associated with improved patient outcomes after surgery. These findings have been used to support important health policy decisions about regionalization of surgical services, in which provision of specific surgical services is restricted to hospitals that maintain operative volumes above a specified threshold. The most common statistical approach in volume-outcome studies is to regress patient outcomes on a set of patient characteristics and a variable denoting provider volume. When outcomes are binary, such as operative mortality, logistic regression is used, resulting in the odds ratio being the reported measure of association. However, the odds ratio is a relative measure of effect and does not allow policy makers to estimate the absolute benefit of regionalization.
OBJECTIVES: To describe how G-computation can be used to estimate the expected number of lives saved due to regionalization of surgical services.
RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective cohort design of patients undergoing 1 of 3 different surgical procedures in Ontario, Canada.
RESULTS: Regionalization of colorectal cancer surgery, esophagectomy, or pancreaticoduodenectomy in Ontario could reduce the average annual number of perioperative deaths by 20.2, 2.0, and 3.6, for the 3 procedures, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The absolute reduction in number of operative deaths due to regionalization of surgical procedures can be calculated. This can help inform health policy debate about benefits of regionalization.},

The authors provide a step-by-step demonstration of G-computation that is intended to familiarize the reader with this procedure. The authors simulate a data set and then demonstrate both G-computation and traditional regression to draw connections and illustrate contrasts between their implementation and interpretation relative to the truth of the simulation protocol. A marginal structural model is used for effect estimation in the G-computation example. The authors conclude by answering a series of questions to emphasize the key characteristics of causal inference techniques and the G-computation procedure in particular.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Asthma-related health resource use and costs may be influenced by increasing asthma prevalence, changes to asthma management guidelines, and new medications over the last decade. The objective of this work was to analyze direct asthma-related medical costs, and trends in total and per-patient costs of hospitalizations, physician visits, and medications.
METHODS: A cohort of asthma patients from British Columbia (BC), Canada, was created. Asthma patients were identified using a validated case definition. Costs for hospitalizations, physician visits, and medications were calculated from billing records (in 2008 Canadian dollars). Trends in total and per-patient costs over the study period were analyzed using Generalized Linear Models.
RESULTS: 398,235 patients satisfied the asthma case definition (mid-point prevalence 8.0\%). Patients consumed \$315.9 million (M) in direct asthma-related health resources between 2002 and 2007. Hospitalizations, physician visits, and medication costs accounted for 16.0\%, 15.7\% and 68.2\% of total costs, respectively. Cost of asthma increased from \$49.4 M in 2002 to \$54.7 M in 2007. Total annual costs attributable to hospitalizations and physician visits decreased (-39.8\% and -25.5\%, respectively; p{\textless}0.001), while medication costs increased (+38.7\%; p{\textless}0.001).
INTERPRETATION: This population-based analysis shows that the total direct cost of asthma in BC has increased since 2002, mainly due to a rise in asthma prevalence and cost of medication. Combination therapy with inhaled corticosteroids/long-acting beta-agonists has become a significant component of the cost of asthma. Although billing records capture only a fraction of the true burden of asthma, the simultaneous increase in medication costs and reductions in hospitalization and physician visit costs provides valuable insight for policy makers into the shifts in asthma-related resource use.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Asthma is a heterogeneous process, yet little is understood regarding phenotypes.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether phenotypic differences exist between early-onset, severe asthma as compared with late-onset disease and whether the presence or absence of eosinophilia influences the phenotypes.
METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of integrated clinical, physiologic, and pathologic data collected from 80 subjects with severe asthma. Subjects were divided into those with asthma onset before age 12 years (n = 50) versus after age 12 (n = 30) and by the presence or absence of lung eosinophils.
RESULTS: Subjects with early-onset, severe asthma had significantly more allergen sensitivity (skin test positivity, 98\% vs 76\%, P {\textless}.007) and more allergic symptoms (P values all {\textless}or=.02) than subjects with late-onset asthma. In contrast, subjects with late-onset asthma had lower lung function (P values =.05 to.07) than early-onset, despite a shorter (P {\textless}.0001) duration of illness. Both groups had a high degree of general asthma symptoms, but those with persistent eosinophils from either age at onset group had significantly more (multiple P values {\textless}.05). Similarly, the presence of eosinophils in either age at onset group was associated with the lowest lung function (P {\textless}or=.02). Although late-onset asthma was associated with the highest numbers of lung eosinophils (P {\textless}.007), only early-onset severe asthma was associated with a lymphocytic/mast cell inflammatory process. Finally, subjects with late-onset asthma without eosinophils had no subepithelial basement membrane thickening, suggesting a different pathologic process.
CONCLUSIONS: Differentiating severe asthma by age at onset and presence or absence of eosinophils identifies phenotypes of asthma, which could benefit subsequent genetic and therapeutic studies.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.rmed.2012.11.014},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical features, physiology, and pathology of severe asthma are poorly understood. Recently, the forced vital capacity (FVC) has been shown to be reduced in severe asthma compared to mild asthma, possibly due to air trapping. However, the natural history and risk factors of obstructive change for such asthmatic patients have not been fully elucidated.
METHODS: We examined the data of a retrospective analysis of lung function changes over a 10-year period in 54 severe asthma patients.
RESULTS: The faster obstructive changes detected by FEV(1) (forced expiratory volume in one second) were accompanied by excessive loss of FVC (r = 0.85, p {\textless} 0.0001) and the reduction in FVC was 1.2 times larger than the FEV(1) change. Age, baseline FVC, exacerbation rate and oral corticosteroids use showed significantly negative correlations with the rate of annual change in FVC.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the decline in FVC is more evident than FEV(1) in severe asthma, suggesting that small airway susceptibility may be the cause of rapid disease progression. Aging, exacerbations of asthma, and use of systemic corticosteroids are related to excess FVC decline, particularly if FVC is still normal.},

DESIGN: The Inhaled Steroid Treatment as Regular Therapy in Early Asthma study was a randomized, double-blind study in 7,165 patients (5 to 66 years old), with persistent asthma for {\textless} 2 years to determine whether early intervention with low-dose inhaled budesonide prevents severe asthma-related events and the decline in lung function. Patients received budesonide (200 mug qd for children {\textless} 11 years old and 400 mug qd for others) or placebo for 3 years in addition to usual asthma medications.
RESULTS: Treatment with budesonide significantly improved prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator FEV(1) percentage of predicted and reduced the mean declines from baseline for postbronchodilator FEV(1) at 1 year and 3 years: - 0.62\% and - 1.79\% for budesonide and - 2.11\% and - 2.68\% for placebo, respectively (p {\textless} 0.001). The decline was more marked for male patients, active smokers, and patients {\textgreater} 18 years old, and the smallest treatment effects were in adolescents.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term, once-daily treatment with low-dose budesonide improved both prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator FEV(1) in patients with recent-onset, persistent asthma, and reduced the loss of lung function over time.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although inhaled glucocorticosteroids are recommended for persistent asthma, their long-term effect on recent onset, mild, persistent asthma has yet to be established.
METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind clinical trial in 7241 patients in 32 countries to assess the effects of budesonide in patients who had had mild persistent asthma for less than 2 years and who had not had previous regular treatment with glucocorticosteroids. Patients aged 5-66 years received either budesonide or placebo once daily for 3 years in addition to their usual asthma medications. The daily budesonide dose was 400 microg, or 200 microg for children younger than 11 years. The primary outcome was time to first severe asthma-related event, and analysis was by intention to treat.
FINDINGS: 198 of 3568 patients on placebo and 117 of 3597 on budesonide had at least one severe asthma exacerbation; hazard ratio 0.56 (95\% CI 0.45-0.71, p{\textless}0.0001). Patients on budesonide had fewer courses of systemic corticosteroids and more symptom-free days than did those on placebo. Compared with placebo, budesonide increased postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) from baseline by 1.48\% (p{\textless}0.0001) after 1 year and by 0.88\% (p=0.0005) after 3 years (expressed as percent of the predicted value). The corresponding increase in prebronchodilator FEV1 was 2.24\% after 1 year and 1.71\% after 3 years (p{\textless}0.0001 at both timepoints). The effect of treatment on all outcome variables was independent of the baseline lung function (prebronchodilator or postbronchodilator) or baseline medication. In children younger than 11 years, 3-year growth was reduced in the budesonide group by 1.34 cm. The reduction was greatest in the first year of treatment (0.58 cm) than years 2 and 3 (0.43 cm and 0.33 cm, respectively).

	abstract = {Environmental exposures during the early years and airway obstruction that develops during this time, in conjunction with genetic susceptibility, are important factors in the development of persistent asthma in childhood. Established risk factors for childhood asthma include frequent wheezing during the first 3 years, a parental history of asthma, a history of eczema, allergic rhinitis, wheezing apart from colds, and peripheral blood eosinophilia, as well as allergic sensitization to aeroallergens and certain foods. Risk factors for the development of asthma in adulthood remain ill defined. Moreover, reasons for variability in the clinical course of asthma--persistence in some individuals and progression in others--remain an enigma. The distinction between disease persistence and disease progression suggests that these are different entities or phenotypes. There is currently no consensus on whether disease progression requires either airway inflammation or airway remodeling or the combination of the two. For patients with irreversible airway obstruction, inflammation might, in part, be necessary but perhaps not entirely sufficient to induce the irreversible component, some of which could be attributed to alterations in the structure of the bronchial wall. Intervening with intermittent or daily inhaled corticosteroids in high-risk infants and children does not prevent disease progression or impaired lung growth. These findings, however, might not apply to adults, and further study in adults is needed to determine the effect of inhaled corticosteroid therapy on disease progression.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Comorbidities are often reported in patients with COPD and may influence the cost of care. Yet, the extent by which comorbidities affect costs remains to be determined.
OBJECTIVES: To review, quantify and evaluate excess costs of comorbidities in COPD.
METHODS: Using a systematic review approach, Pubmed and Embase were searched for studies analyzing excess costs of comorbidities in COPD. Resulting studies were evaluated according to study characteristics, comorbidity measurement and cost indicators. Mark-up factors were calculated for respective excess costs. Furthermore, a checklist of quality criteria was applied.
RESULTS: Twelve studies were included. Nine evaluated comorbidity specific costs; three examined index-based results. Pneumonia, cardiovascular disease and diabetes were associated with the highest excess costs. The mark-up factors for respective excess costs ranged between 1.5 and 2.5 in the majority of cases. On average the factors constituted a doubling of respective costs in the comorbid case. The main cost driver, among all studies, was inpatient cost. Indirect costs were not accounted for by the majority of studies. Study heterogeneity was high.
CONCLUSIONS: The reviewed studies clearly show that comorbidities are associated with significant excess costs in COPD. The inclusion of comorbid costs and effects in future health economic evaluations of preventive or therapeutic COPD interventions seems highly advisable.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To characterize a comprehensive comorbidity profile and to explore the economic implications of comorbidity among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed medical claims from the Maryland Medicaid database. We employed a 1:2 case-control design to select COPD patients (n=1388) and demographically matched controls (n=2776) aged 40 to 64 years with 24 months of continuous enrollment. Odds ratios were employed to compare comorbidity differences, including 17 conditions defined by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and 6 additional conditions commonly observed in COPD patients. We estimated the incremental medical utilization and medical cost by specific condition.
RESULTS: Compared with the controls, Medicaid COPD patients had higher comorbidity burden and were more likely to have myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, peptic ulcer, mild liver disease, hypertension, sleep apnea, tobacco use, and edema. COPD patients on average had 24\% more medical claims (81.4 vs. 65.4, p{\textless}0.001) and were 33\% more expensive than controls (\$7603 vs. \$5732, p{\textless}0.001). Ten conditions defined by the CCI as well as hypertension, tobacco use, and edema were associated with incremental medical utilization and cost in COPD patients; depression was associated with incremental medical utilization but not cost.
CONCLUSIONS: The high burden of comorbidity in COPD patients translates into additional medical utilization and cost. Effective disease management and treatment protocols are needed to reduce comorbidity burden. The development of a COPD-specific comorbidity measure may be used to identify high-risk subgroups and to predict utilization and cost.},

METHODS: Using data from two population-based studies in Southern Germany, current GOLD criteria were applied to pre-bronchodilator spirometry for COPD diagnosis and staging in 2255 participants aged 41 to 89. Utilization of physician visits, hospital stays and medication was compared between participants with COPD stage I, stage II+ (II or higher) and controls. Costs per year were calculated by applying national unit costs. In controlling for confounders, two-part generalized regression analyses were used to account for the skewed distribution of costs and the high proportion of subjects without costs.
RESULTS: Utilization in all categories was significantly higher in COPD patients than in controls. After adjusting for confounders, these differences remained present in physician visits and medication, but not in hospital days. Adjusted annual costs did not differ between stage I (€ 1830) and controls (€ 1822), but increased by about 54\% to € 2812 in stage II+.
CONCLUSION: The finding that utilization and costs are considerably higher in moderate but not in mild COPD highlights the economic importance of prevention and of interventions aiming at early diagnosis and delayed disease progression.},

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, and progressive lung function decline. In Italy, an estimated 2.6 million men and women have COPD, and the disease causes around 18 000 deaths each year. In addition to mortality, morbidity from COPD results in substantial use of secondary healthcare resources. The burden of COPD in Italy may be due to the underdiagnosis of the disease by healthcare professionals, particularly in the early stages of the disease, and a lack of awareness among physicians of recommended treatment practices. In an attempt to address the need for information on the burden of COPD, a large-scale international survey, Confronting COPD in North America and Europe, assessed clinical outcomes, use of healthcare resources and loss of productivity in the workplace, and the economic cost of this disease in Italy and six other countries. In Italy, the economic analysis of the survey data showed that the mean annual cost of COPD to the healthcare system was Euro 1261.25 per patient Indirect costs were estimated at Euro 47.29 per patient, bringing the societal cost of the disease to Euro 1308.54 per patient. Three-quarters of the direct per patient cost of COPD in Italy were accounted for by inpatient hospitalizations (Euro 963.10), suggesting that interventions aimed at preventing exacerbations could alleviate the burden of COPD in Italy. The high impact of COPD on the Italian healthcare system is also likely to be a consequence of the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of the disease, suggesting that costs may be reduced by increasing the utilization of spirometry as a diagnostic tool, and improving physician adherence to treatment guidelines. Patients with severe COPD and other comorbidities showed higher costs (Euro 6366 and Euro 1861, respectively) than patients with mild disease (Euro 441) or no comorbidities (Euro 1021), underlying the importance of smoking cessation interventions to prevent disease progression.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known about cost implications of anemia and its association with mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This claims analysis addresses these questions.
METHODS: Using the the US Medicare claims database (1997-2001), this study identified Medicare enrollees with an ICD-9 diagnosis of COPD. Concomitant anemia was identified based on ICD-9 codes or receipt of transfusions. Persons with anemia secondary to another disease state, a nutritional deficiency or a hereditary disease were excluded. Medicare claims and payments, resource utilization and mortality were compared between COPD patients with and without anemia.
RESULTS: Of the 132,424 enrollees with a COPD diagnosis, 21\% (n = 27,932) had concomitant anemia. At baseline, anemic patients were older, had more co-morbidities and higher rates of health care resource use than non-anemic individuals with COPD. In a univariate analysis annual Medicare payments for persons with anemia were more than double for those without anemia (\$1,466 vs. \$649, p {\textless} 0.001), the direction maintained in all categories of payments. Adjusting for demographics, co-morbidities, and other markers of disease severity revealed that anemia was independently associated with \$3,582 incremental increase per patient (95\% CI: \$3,299 to \$3,865) in Medicare annual reimbursements. The mortality rate among COPD patients with anemia was 262 vs. 133 deaths per 1,000 person-years among those without anemia (p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Anemia was present in 21\% of COPD patients. Although more prevalent in more severely ill COPD patients, anemia significantly and independently contributes to the costs of care for COPD and is associated with increased mortality.},

Study Design  A retrospective, longitudinal study using claims linked to eligibility/demographic data for a 5\% sample of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries from 2005 through 2007.    Methods  Incidence rates of pneumonia were calculated for elders with and without COPD and for elders with COPD and coexistent congestive heart failure (CHF).   Propensity-score matching with multivariate generalized linear regression was used to estimate the excess direct medical cost of inpatient primary pneumonia in elders with COPD as compared with elders with COPD but without a pneumonia hospitalization.    Results  Elders with COPD had nearly six-times the incidence of pneumonia compared with elders without COPD (167.6/1000 person-years versus 29.5/1000 person-years; RR=5.7, p \&lt;0 .01); RR increased to 8.1 for elders with COPD and CHF compared with elders without COPD.  The incidence of inpatient primary pneumonia among elders with COPD was 54.2/1000 person-years compared with 7/1000 person-years for elders without COPD; RR=7.7, p\&lt;0.01); RR increased to 11.0 for elders with COPD and CHF compared with elders without COPD.  The one-year excess direct medical cost of inpatient pneumonia in COPD patients was  \$ 22,697  (\$45,456 in cases vs. \$ 22,759 in controls (p \&lt;0.01)); 70.2\% of this cost was accrued during the quarter of the index hospitalization. During months 13 through 24 following the index hospitalization, the excess direct medical cost was  \$ 5,941  (\$23,215 in cases vs. \$ 17,274 in controls, p\&lt;0.01).    Conclusions  Pneumonia occurs more frequently in elders with COPD than without COPD.  The excess direct medical cost in elders with inpatient pneumonia extends up to 24 months following the index hospitalization and represents \$28,638 in 2010 dollars.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Compare the prevalence of comorbidities in adults with and without asthma in Canada and investigate the association between comorbidities in patients with asthma and the occurrence of asthma symptoms or attacks.
METHODS: Survey data from the 2005 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) were analyzed. A total of 132,221 Canadians participated in the national survey; 10,089 adult respondents from 10 Canadian provinces and 3 territories reported having asthma. Analyses focused on 11 major chronic comorbidities.
RESULTS: Respondents with asthma were more likely to have comorbidities except cancer; 31\% of respondents with asthma and comorbidities reported their health status to be fair or poor. For respondents with asthma, non-asthma chronic respiratory disease, mental illness, and allergy were significantly associated with having asthma symptoms or attacks.
CONCLUSIONS: Many Canadians with asthma report a high comorbidity burden. These patients will likely require more health services and more complex health management strategies. Comorbid conditions should be clearly identified with particular emphasis on management of mood disorders and anxiety because these conditions are likely to increase asthma symptomatology and may be unrecognized by clinicians.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Asthma comorbidity, such as depression and obesity, has been associated with greater healthcare use, decreased quality of life and poor asthma control. Treating this comorbidity has been shown to improve asthma outcomes as well as overall health. Despite this, asthma comorbidity remains relatively under-recognised and understudied-perhaps because most asthma occurs in young people who are believed to be healthy and relatively free of comorbidity. The aim of this study was to quantify empirically the amount of comorbidity associated with asthma.
METHODS: A population-based cohort study was conducted using the health administrative data of the 12 million residents of Ontario, Canada in 2005. A validated health administrative algorithm was used to identify individuals with asthma.
RESULTS: The amount of comorbidity among individuals with asthma, as reflected in rates of hospitalisations, emergency department visits and ambulatory care claims, was found to be substantial and much greater than that observed among individuals without asthma. Together, asthma and asthma comorbidity (the extra comorbidity found in individuals with asthma compared with those without asthma) were associated with 6\% of all hospitalisations, 9\% of all emergency room visits and 6\% of all ambulatory care visits that occurred in Ontario.
CONCLUSIONS: Asthma comorbidity places a significant burden on individuals and the healthcare system and should be considered in the management of asthma. Further research should focus on which types of asthma comorbidity are responsible for the greatest burden and how such comorbidity should be prevented and managed.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To provide physicians with current guidelines for the diagnosis and optimal management of asthma in children and adults, including pregnant women and the elderly, in office, emergency department, hospital and clinic settings.
Options: The consensus group considered the roles of education, avoidance of provocative environmental and other factors, diverse pharmacotherapies, delivery devices and emergency and in-hospital management of asthma.
Outcomes: Provision of the best control of asthma by confirmation of the diagnosis using objective measures, rapid achievement and maintenance of control and regular follow-up.
Evidence: The key diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations are based on the 1995 Canadian guidelines and a critical review of the literature by small groups before a full meeting of the consensus group. Recommendations are graded according to 5 levels of evidence. Differences of opinion were resolved by consensus following discussion.
Values: Respirologists, immunoallergists, pediatricians and emergency and family physicians gave prime consideration to the achievement and maintenance of optimal control of asthma through avoidance of environmental inciters, education of patients and the lowest effective regime of pharmacotherapy to reduce morbidity and mortality.
Benefits, harms and costs: Adherence to the guidelines should be accompanied by significant reduction in patients' symptoms, reduced morbidity and mortality, fewer emergency and hospital admissions, fewer adverse side-effects from medications, better quality of life for patients and reduced costs.
Recommendations: Recommendations are included in each section of the report. In summary, after a diagnosis of asthma is made based on clinical evaluation, including demonstration of variable airflow obstruction, and contributing factors are identified, a treatment plan is established to obtain and maintain optimal asthma control. The main components of treatment are patient education, environmental control, pharmacotherapy tailored to the individual and regular follow-up.
Validation: The recommendations were distributed to the members of the Canadian Thoracic Society Asthma and Standards Committees, as well as members of the board of the Canadian Thoracic Society. In addition, collaborating groups representing the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, the Canadian College of Family Physicians, the Canadian Paediatric Society and the Canadian Society of Allergy and Immunology were asked to validate the recommendations. The recommendations were discussed at regional meetings throughout Canada. They were also compared with the recommendations of other similar groups in other countries.
Dissemination and implementation: An implementation committee has established a strategy for disseminating these guidelines to physicians, other health professionals and patients and for developing tools and means that will help integrate the recommendations into current asthma care. The plan is outlined in this report.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the associations of long-term exposure to elevated traffic-related air pollution and woodsmoke pollution with the risk of COPD hospitalization and mortality.
METHODS: This population-based cohort study included a 5-year exposure period and a 4-year follow-up period. All residents aged 45-85 years who resided in Metropolitan Vancouver, Canada, during the exposure period and did not have known COPD at baseline were included in this study (n = 467,994). Residential exposures to traffic-related air pollutants (black carbon, particulate matter {\textless}2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide, and nitric oxide) and woodsmoke were estimated using land-use regression models and integrating changes in residences during the exposure period. COPD hospitalizations and deaths during the follow-up period were identified from provincial hospitalization and death registration databases.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: An interquartile range elevation in black carbon concentrations (0.97 × 10(-5)/m, equivalent to 0.78 μg/m(3) elemental carbon) was associated with a 6\% (95\% confidence interval, 2-10\%) increase in COPD hospitalizations and a 7\% (0-13\%) increase in COPD mortality after adjustment for covariates. Exposure to higher levels of woodsmoke pollution (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1) was associated with a 15\% (2-29\%) increase in COPD hospitalizations. There were positive exposure-response trends for these observed associations.
CONCLUSIONS: Ambient air pollution, including traffic-related fine particulate pollution and woodsmoke pollution, is associated with an increased risk of COPD.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a prospectively applicable method for classifying comorbid conditions which might alter the risk of mortality for use in longitudinal studies. A weighted index that takes into account the number and the seriousness of comorbid disease was developed in a cohort of 559 medical patients. The 1-yr mortality rates for the different scores were: "0", 12\% (181); "1-2", 26\% (225); "3-4", 52\% (71); and "greater than or equal to 5", 85\% (82). The index was tested for its ability to predict risk of death from comorbid disease in the second cohort of 685 patients during a 10-yr follow-up. The percent of patients who died of comorbid disease for the different scores were: "0", 8\% (588); "1", 25\% (54); "2", 48\% (25); "greater than or equal to 3", 59\% (18). With each increased level of the comorbidity index, there were stepwise increases in the cumulative mortality attributable to comorbid disease (log rank chi 2 = 165; p less than 0.0001). In this longer follow-up, age was also a predictor of mortality (p less than 0.001). The new index performed similarly to a previous system devised by Kaplan and Feinstein. The method of classifying comorbidity provides a simple, readily applicable and valid method of estimating risk of death from comorbid disease for use in longitudinal studies. Further work in larger populations is still required to refine the approach because the number of patients with any given condition in this study was relatively small.},

	abstract = {Background: Health care office staff and providers may discriminate against people of low socioeconomic status, even in the absence of economic incentives to do so. We sought to determine whether socioeconomic status affects the response a patient receives when seeking a primary care appointment.
Methods: In a single unannounced telephone call to a random sample of family physicians and general practices (n = 375) in Toronto, Ontario, a male and a female researcher each played the role of a patient seeking a primary care physician. Callers followed a script suggesting either high (i.e., bank employee transferred to the city) or low (i.e., recipient of social assistance) socioeconomic status, and either the presence or absence of chronic health conditions (diabetes and low back pain). We randomized the characteristics of the caller for each office. Our primary outcome was whether the caller was offered an appointment.
Results: The proportion of calls resulting in an appointment being offered was significantly higher when the callers presented themselves as having high socioeconomic status than when they presented as having low socioeconomic status (22.6\% v.14.3\%, p = 0.04) and when the callers stated the presence of chronic health conditions than when they did not (23.5\% v. 12.8\%, p = 0.008). In a model adjusted for all independent variables significant at a p value of 0.10 or less (presence of chronic health conditions, time since graduation from medical school and membership in the College of Family Physicians of Canada), high socio economic status was associated with an odds ratio of 1.78 (95\% confidence interval 1.02–3.08) for the offer of an appointment.Socio economic status and chronic health conditions had independent effects on the likelihood of obtaining an appointment.
Interpretation: Within a universal health insurance system in which physician reimbursement is unaffected by patients' socioeconomic status, people presenting themselves as having high socioeconomic status received preferential access to primary care over those presenting themselves as having low socioeconomic status.},

	abstract = {Objective
We estimate long-term health care costs of former smokers compared with continuing and never smokers using a retrospective cohort study of HMO enrollees. Previous research on health care costs associated with former smokers has suggested that quitters may incur greater health care costs than continuing smokers, therefore, getting people to quit creates more expensive health care consumers. We studied the trend in cost for former smokers over seven years after they quit to assess how the cessation experience impacts total health care cost.

Data Sources/Study Setting
Group Health Cooperative (GHC), a nonprofit mixed model health maintenance organization in western Washington state.

Study Design
Retrospective cohort study using automated and primary data collected through telephone interviews.

Principal Findings
We find that former smokers' costs are significantly greater (p{\textless}.05) in the year immediately following cessation relative to continuing smokers, but former smokers' costs fall in year two. This decrease maintains throughout the six-year follow-up period. Although former smokers cost more than continuing smokers in the year after cessation, this increase appears to be transient. Long-term costs for former smokers are not statistically different from those of continuing smokers and cumulative health care expenses are lower by the seventh year postquit. Our evidence suggests that smoking cessation does not increase long-term heath care costs.

Conclusions
Health care costs among former smokers increase relative to continuing smokers in the year after cessation but fall to a level that is statistically indistinguishable in the second year postquit. Any net increase in costs among former smokers relative to continuing smokers appears compensated for within two years post-quit and is maintained for at least six years after cessation.},

Both family SES and neighborhood SES predicted negative psychological characteristics and experiences such as hostility and discrimination. In contrast, only subjective SES predicted positive psychological characteristics. These findings suggest the importance of understanding influences at the individual, family, and neighborhood levels for optimally targeting interventions to reduce health disparities earlier in life.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study is aimed at providing a real-world evaluation of the economic cost of persistent asthma among European adults according to the degree of disease control [as defined by the 2006 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines].
METHODS: A prevalence-based cost-of-illness study was carried out on 462 patients aged 30-54 years with persistent asthma (according to the 2002 GINA definition), who were identified in general population samples from 11 European countries and examined in clinical settings in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey II between 1999 and 2002. The cost estimates were computed from the societal perspective following the bottom-up approach on the basis of rates, wages and prices in 2004 (obtained at the national level from official sources), and were then converted to the 2010 values.
RESULTS: The mean total cost per patient was EUR 1,583 and was largely driven by indirect costs (i.e. lost working days and days with limited, not work-related activities 62.5\%). The expected total cost in the population aged 30-54 years of the 11 European countries was EUR 4.3 billion (EUR 19.3 billion when extended to the whole European population aged from 15 to 64 years). The mean total cost per patient ranged from EUR 509 (controlled asthma) to EUR 2,281 (uncontrolled disease). Chronic cough or phlegm and having a high BMI significantly increased the individual total cost.
CONCLUSIONS: Among European adults, the cost of persistent asthma drastically increases as disease control decreases. Therefore, substantial cost savings could be obtained through the proper management of adult patients in Europe.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The economic burden of asthma is an important measure of the effect of asthma on society. Although asthma is a costly illness, the total cost of asthma to society has not been estimated in more than a decade.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to provide the public with current estimates of the incremental direct medical costs and productivity losses due to morbidity and mortality from asthma at both the individual and national levels for the years 2002-2007.
METHODS: Data came from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Two-part models were used to estimate the incremental direct costs of asthma. The incremental number of days lost from work and school was estimated by negative binomial regressions and valued following the human capital approach. Published data were used to value lives lost with an underlying cause of asthma.
RESULTS: Over the years 2002-2007, the incremental direct cost of asthma was \$3,259 (2009 dollars) per person per year. The value of additional days lost attributable to asthma per year was approximately \$301 for each worker and \$93 for each student. For the most recent year available, 2007, the total incremental cost of asthma to society was \$56 billion, with productivity losses due to morbidity accounting for \$3.8 billion and productivity losses due to mortality accounting for \$2.1 billion.
CONCLUSION: The current study finds that the estimated costs of asthma are substantial, which stresses the necessity for research and policy to work toward reducing the economic burden of asthma.},

METHODS: Participants in the National Access to Care Survey were asked whether they had experienced any of 15 highly serious or morbid symptoms. Those who did were asked whether they received medical care and, if care was not received, whether care was thought to have been necessary.
RESULTS: A total of 574 respondents (16.4\%) reported 794 new serious or morbid symptoms. Of these, 499 people (86.9\%) had health insurance, and they reported 691 new symptoms; 75 (13.1\%) lacked health insurance, and they reported 103 symptoms. The uninsured were less likely to have received medical care and more likely to say they did not receive care even though they thought it was needed (P = .001). Medical care was received for 45.4\% of symptoms for the insured and 24.3\% for the uninsured; care was not thought to have been needed for 41.0\% of symptoms for the insured and 45.6\% for the uninsured; and care was thought necessary but was not received for 13.6\% of symptoms for the insured and 30.1\% for the uninsured.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: --To determine the importance of the emergency department as the means of access to the hospital for the poor and the fiscal implications of providing these services, we examined the relationship between patients' socioeconomic status and admission via the emergency department. We also determined the association between entering the hospital via the emergency department and hospital resource use.
METHODS: --We conducted a study of 20,089 patients admitted to five Massachusetts hospitals (three community, two tertiary care) during a 6-month period. We determined the proportions of patients within various socioeconomic and disease groupings who entered through the emergency department. We compared length of stay and charges for patients admitted through the emergency department with those for patients admitted through other routes.
RESULTS: --Overall, 51\% of patients entered via the emergency department. Elderly patients (age greater than 65 years; odds ratio, 1.87) and patients with lower socioeconomic status as measured by income, occupation, and education (odds ratios, 2.38, 1.47, and 1.69, respectively) were more likely to enter the hospital via the emergency department than other patients. After adjustment for diagnosis related group, severity as measured by DRGSCALE, and socioeconomic status as measured by income, and excluding outliers, patients admitted via the emergency department stayed 27\% longer and incurred 13\% higher charges than other patients (P less than .001).
CONCLUSIONS: --Our data indicate that patients with lower socioeconomic status are more likely than other patients to use the emergency department as their means of access to the hospital and that patients admitted via the emergency department use far more resources than patients in the same diagnosis related group admitted by other means. Hospitals that make emergency department services more available may be more likely to hospitalize socioeconomically disadvantaged patients and may be at a substantial financial disadvantage under per-case reimbursement systems such as Medicare.},

	volume = {129},
	issn = {0003-4819},
	abstract = {Many health care professionals have sustained an almost single-minded conviction that disparities in access to health care across socioeconomic groups are the key reason for the major discrepancies in health status between wealthy persons and poor persons. Others, however, have argued that a host of factors work to create major impediments and that reducing or eliminating financial barriers to health care in particular will do little to reduce discrepancies in health status. This paper, while acknowledging the spectrum of contributing factors, argues that the elimination of financially based differences in access is central to any effort to create equity in outcomes across socioeconomic groups. Through selected review of the many studies on health insurance, access, outcomes, and socioeconomic status, it establishes that a core links affected populations, their difficulty in financing health care, and the threat to their well-being. In so doing, it cites findings that strongly associate lack of insurance (especially for persons who live in poverty), inability to obtain services, and adverse health outcomes. It also uses the example of Medicaid and other coverage for HIV-infected persons in particular as an important positive instance in which leveling the discrepancies in health care across socioeconomic groups can move toward creating quality in access and outcomes. The competitive pressures in today's health care environment threaten to drive socioeconomic groups further apart, especially insured and uninsured persons. However, the recent enactment of state actions, especially the State Child Health Insurance Program, represent powerful examples of health insurance expansion that have lessons for policymakers at all levels for the monitoring and reduction of socioeconomic disparities.},

We aim to discuss current insights into our understanding of the mechanisms by which socioeconomic status (SES) influences the prevalence and severity of asthma in ethnic minorities. In addition, we review potential risk factors for ethnic disparities in asthma that are not mediated by SES.

Recent findings
Exposures and factors correlated with ethnicity through SES (e.g. indoor and outdoor air quality, smoke exposure, and access to healthcare) are likely to explain a significant proportion of the observed ethnic differences in asthma morbidity. However, other factors correlated with ethnicity (e.g., genetic variation) can impact ethnic disparities in asthma independently of and/or interacting with SES-related factors.

Summary
SES is a rough marker of a variety of environmental/behavioral exposures and a very important determinant of differences in asthma prevalence and severity among ethnic minorities in the U.S. However, SES is unlikely to be the sole explanation for ethnic disparities in asthma, which may also be due to differences in genetic variation and gene-by-environment interactions among ethnic groups.},

Most of these studies have been cross sectional in design and have relied on subjective markers of asthma such as symptoms of wheeze. Many have been unable to control adequately for potential confounding factors.
Methods: We report a prospective cohort study of approximately 1000 individuals born in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1972–3. This sample has been assessed regularly throughout childhood and into adulthood, with detailed information collected on asthma symptoms, lung function, airway responsiveness, and atopy. The prevalence of these in relation to measures of socioeconomic status were analysed with and without controls for potential confounding influences including parental history of asthma, smoking, breast feeding, and birth order using cross sectional time series models.
Results: No consistent association was found between childhood or adult socioeconomic status and asthma prevalence, lung function, or airway responsiveness at any age. Having asthma made no difference to educational attainment or socioeconomic status by age 26. There were trends to increased atopy in children from higher socioeconomic status families consistent with previous reports.
Conclusions: Socioeconomic status in childhood had no significant impact on the prevalence of asthma in this New Zealand born cohort. Generalisation of these results to other societies should be done with caution, but our results suggest that the previously reported associations may be due to confounding.},

	shorttitle = {Can universal access to health care eliminate health inequities between children of poor and nonpoor families?},
	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Children from poor families are much more likely to have emergency visits for asthma than those from nonpoor families, which may be related to financial access barriers to good preventive care for the poor. We sought to determine whether in a health-care system that provides free access to outpatient and hospital services, the disparities in the rates of emergency visits for asthma would be less apparent across the income gradient.
DESIGN: Longitudinal, population-based study.
SETTING: Alberta, Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: All children born in Alberta, Canada between 1985 and 1988 (n = 90,845) were classified into three mutually exclusive groups based on the reported annual income of their parents from the previous year: very poor, poor, and nonpoor groups.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We compared the relative risk (RR) of emergency visits for childhood asthma among children of very poor, poor, and nonpoor families using a Cox proportional hazard model during a 10-year follow-up. We found that the very poor children were 23\% more likely to have had an emergency visit for asthma than those from nonpoor families (RR, 1.23; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 1.33), adjusted for a variety of factors. The poor group, however, had a similar risk of asthma emergency visits as the nonpoor group (RR, 0.97; 95\% CI, 0.91 to 1.04). The average number of office visits for asthma was similar between the very poor and nonpoor groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In a setting of universal access to health care, children of poor and nonpoor families had similar rates of asthma emergency visits; the very poor children, however, continued to experience an excess risk. These findings suggest that a universal health-care system can reduce, but not fully eliminate, the disparities in emergency utilization of asthma across income categories.},

	abstract = {Investigators of social differentials in health outcomes commonly augment incomplete micro data by appending socioeconomic characteristics of residential areas (such as median income in a zip code) to proxy for individual characteristics. However, little empirical attention has been paid to how well this aggregate information serves as a proxy for the individual characteristics of interest. We build on recent work addressing the biases inherent in proxies and consider two health-related examples within a statistical framework that illuminate the nature and sources of biases. Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey are linked to census data. We assess the validity of using the aggregate census information as a proxy for individual information when estimating main effects, and when controlling for potential confounding between socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors in measures of general health status and infant mortality. We find a general, but not universal, tendency for aggregate proxies to exaggerate the effects of micro-level variables and to do more poorly than micro-level variables at controlling for confounding. The magnitude and direction of these biases, however, vary across samples. Our statistical framework and empirical findings suggest the difficulties in and limits to interpreting proxies derived from aggregate census data as if they were micro-level variables. The statistical framework we outline for our study of health outcomes should be generally applicable to other situations where researchers have merged aggregate data with micro data samples.},

	abstract = {In this article, practical problems with multilevel techniques are discussed. These problems, brought to our attention by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), have to do with terminology, computer programs employing different algorithms, and interpretations of the coefficients in one or two steps. We discuss the usefulness of the hierarchical linear model (HM) in the most common situation in education—that of a large number of relatively small groups. We also point to situations where the more complicated HMs can be replaced with simpler models, with statistical properties that are easier to study. We conclude that more studies need to be done to establish the claimed superiority of restricted versus unrestricted maximum likelihood, to study the effects of shrinkage on the estimators, and to explore the merits of simpler methods such as weighted least squares. Finally, distinctions must be made between choice of model, choice of technique, choice of algorithm, and choice of computer program. While HMs are an elegant conceptualization, they are not always necessary. Traditional techniques perform as well, or better, if there are large groups and small intraclass correlations, and if the researcher is interested only in the fixed-level regression coefficients.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Interest in the effects of neighbourhood or local area social characteristics on health has increased in recent years, but to date the existing evidence has not been systematically reviewed. Multilevel or contextual analyses of social factors and health represent a possible reconciliation between two divergent epidemiological paradigms-individual risk factor epidemiology and an ecological approach.
DATA SOURCES: Keyword searching of Index Medicus (Medline) and additional references from retrieved articles.
STUDY SELECTION: All original studies of the effect of local area social characteristics on individual health outcomes, adjusted for individual socioeconomic status, published in English before 1 June 1998 and focused on populations in developed countries.
DATA SYNTHESIS: The methodological challenges posed by the design and interpretation of multilevel studies of local area effects are discussed and results summarised with reference to type of health outcome. All but two of the 25 reviewed studies reported a statistically significant association between at least one measure of social environment and a health outcome (contextual effect), after adjusting for individual level socioeconomic status (compositional effect). Contextual effects were generally modest and much smaller than compositional effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for modest neighbourhood effects on health is fairly consistent despite heterogeneity of study designs, substitution of local area measures for neighbourhood measures and probable measurement error. By drawing public health attention to the health risks associated with the social structure and ecology of neighbourhoods, innovative approaches to community level interventions may ensue.},

We examined the prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma, bronchitis, and airways obstruction (total respiratory morbidity [TRM]) in Winnipeg in 1988 and 1992, using place of residence to divide people into quintiles according to average family income. Physician office visits, hospitalizations, and consultation referrals were each examined. Three age groups: 0 to 14 yr, 15 to 34 yr, and {\textgreater} or = 35 yr were studied. The prevalence of TRM was greater in low- than in high-income quintiles. Asthma prevalence was unrelated to income in the younger age groups; in the older group asthma was more common in low-income groups, but was less strongly related to income than was TRM. Asthma prevalence increased over the years studied, but the increase was not related to income level. There was some evidence of income-related diagnostic bias in that low-income patients were more likely to be labeled with a related diagnosis in addition to asthma than were high-income patients. Low-income patients had more physician contacts than did high-income patients. In terms of physician office visits, care continuity did not differ among income quintiles. Low-income quintiles had more hospitalizations than did high-income quintiles, and differences were larger than could be accounted for by diagnostic bias; asthma was probably more severe in low-income quintiles. High-income quintiles had more consultation referrals than did low-income quintiles.},

Data Sources/Study Setting.  Physician claims and hospital discharge abstracts from fiscal years 1998 to 2001 for urban residents of Manitoba, Canada. The 1996 Canadian Census public use database provided neighborhood household income information. The study included all continuously enrolled urban residents in the Manitoba Health Services Insurance Plan. Study Design.  Twelve ACS conditions definable using 3-digit ICD-9-CM codes permitted cross-sectional and longitudinal comparison of ambulatory visits and hospitalizations. Neighborhood household income data provided a measure of socioeconomic status. Data Collection/Extraction Methods.  Files were extracted from administrative data housed at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy. Principal Findings.  All conditions showed a socioeconomic gradient with residents of the lowest income neighborhoods having both more visits and more hospitalizations than their counterparts in higher income areas. Six of nine conditions with a sufficient N showed individuals living in the lowest income neighborhoods to have significantly more ambulatory visits before hospitalization for an ACS condition than did those in the most affluent neighborhoods. Many conditions showed a gradient in rate of hospitalization even after controlling for the number of ambulatory care visits. Conclusions.  In the Canadian universal health care plan, the poor have reasonable access to ambulatory care for ACS conditions. Ambulatory care may be more effective in preventing hospitalizations among relatively affluent individuals than among the less well off.},

	abstract = {Background
Asthma is one of the most common inflammatory lung diseases and its prevalence and incidence have increased in many developed and developing countries. Asthma places a heavy burden on healthcare expenditures and productivity, which in turn diminishes the quality of life of the individuals involved as well as their families. The goal of improving a patient's knowledge about asthma management should include the enhancement of the individual's skills with the hopeful outcome of improving how the individual manages the condition. However, when health professionals prepare a training program, they are faced with the challenging cosmopolitan reality of individuals with different ethnic backgrounds.

Methods
In order to find links between asthma and health literacy in a cultural/ethnicity perspective, we performed a systematic review of all publications on the topic of asthma, health, and literacy among cultural groups from 1980 to 2006 using the Internet and journals: Medline (Ovid), ERIC, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Google, Google Scholar, Sociological Abstracts, and Anthropology Plus. Key words included the following: “asthma,” “culture,” “ethnicity,” “literacy,” “health,” “health literacy,” “health beliefs,” “adults,” “disease management,” “chronic condition,” “ethnocultural groups,” “minority groups,” and “newcomers/immigrants.”

Results
More than 650 articles were initially identified in our review; 65 met our inclusion criteria. From these, we examined the factors related to asthma and literacy/health literacy with a cultural lens. All of these are categorized and summarized below. We chose what we considered to be the most relevant and important articles/documents in the research literature to date. Because many of the studies were qualitative, a formal meta-analytic review was not undertaken. We found that current asthma management techniques – including patient education – are not culturally sensitive, linguistically sensitive, or relevant, which creates further difficulties for ethnocultural communities and minority groups in many Western countries. In this systematic review, several themes were identified, including: approaches to language limitation and cultural barriers; the recognition of healthcare system bias (in terms of culturally competent care); and relationship-building to facilitate participatory decision-making by both provider and patient. This review provides further understanding and considerations regarding the beliefs and perspectives of care providers and populations in relation to health and illness, literacy and health literacy, and their association with asthma among ethnocultural communities.

Conclusions
There is an urgent need to better define the impact of cultural and ethnic issues in the management of asthma in Canada. Appropriately designed studies should better define the barriers in the optimal delivery of asthma care influenced by these parameters.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify the adherence value cut-off point that optimally stratifies good versus poor compliers using administratively derived adherence measures, the medication possession ratio (MPR) and the proportion of days covered (PDC) using hospitalization episode as the primary outcome among Medicaid eligible persons diagnosed with schizophrenia, diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF), or hyperlipidemia.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of Arkansas Medicaid administrative claims data. Patients {\textgreater} or =18 years old had to have at least one ICD-9-CM code for the study diseases during the recruitment period July 2000 through April 2004 and be continuously eligible for 6 months prior and 24 months after their first prescription for the target condition. Adherence rates to disease-specific drug therapy were assessed during 1 year using MPR and PDC. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE AND ANALYSIS SCHEME: The primary outcome measure was any-cause and disease-related hospitalization. Univariate logistic regression models were used to predict hospitalizations. The optimum adherence value was based on the adherence value that corresponded to the upper most left point of the ROC curve corresponding to the maximum specificity and sensitivity.
RESULTS: The optimal cut-off adherence value for the MPR and PDC in predicting any-cause hospitalization varied between 0.63 and 0.89 across the five cohorts. In predicting disease-specific hospitalization across the five cohorts, the optimal cut-off adherence values ranged from 0.58 to 0.85.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provided an initial empirical basis for selecting 0.80 as a reasonable cut-off point that stratifies adherent and non-adherent patients based on predicting subsequent hospitalization across several highly prevalent chronic diseases. This cut-off point has been widely used in previous research and our findings suggest that it may be valid in these conditions; it is based on a single outcome measure, and additional research using these methods to identify adherence thresholds using other outcome metrics such as laboratory or physiologic measures, which may be more strongly related to adherence, is warranted.},

	shorttitle = {Double trouble},
	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC80815/},
	abstract = {Background
There is considerable controversy about the regular use of short- acting β-agonists for the treatment of asthma. Although case–control studies have suggested that excessive use of these drugs may worsen asthma control and increase the risk of fatal or near-fatal asthma, the controversy remains unresolved because of the confounding that exists among disease control, disease severity and the use of short-acting β-agonists. Whatever the cause-and-effect relation between the use of short-acting β-agonists and disease severity, we hypothesized that their excessive use, in conjunction with underuse of inhaled corticosteroids, would be a marker for poorly controlled asthma and excessive use of health care resources.

Methods
To characterize the pattern of health services utilization among asthmatic patients taking various doses of inhaled β-agonists and corticosteroids in British Columbia, we linked the relevant health administrative databases. All patients between 5 and 50 years of age for whom a prescription for a short-acting β-agonist was filled in 1995 and whose prescription data were captured through the provincial drug plan were included in a retrospective analysis of prescriptions for asthma drugs, physician prescribing patterns and health services utilization. Patients' use of asthma medication was classified as appropriate (low doses of short-acting β-agonist and high doses of inhaled corticosteroid) or inappropriate (high doses of short-acting β-agonist and low doses of inhaled corticosteroid), and the 2 resulting groups were compared, by means of logistic, Poisson and gamma regression, for differences in prescribing patterns, physician visits and use of hospital resources.

Results
A total of 23 986 patients were identified as having filled a prescription for a short-acting β-agonist (for inhalation) in 1995. Of these, 3069 (12.8\%) filled prescriptions for 9 or more canisters of β-agonist, and of this group of high-dose β-agonist users, 763 (24.9\%) used no more than 100 μg/day of inhaled beclomethasone. On average, those with inappropriate use of β-agonists visited significantly more physicians for their prescriptions (1.8 v. 1.4), and each of these physicians on average wrote significantly more prescriptions for asthma medications per patient than the physicians who prescribed to appropriate users (5.2 v. 2.5 prescriptions). Patients with inappropriate use were more likely to be admitted to hospital (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.68, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.25–2.26), were admitted to hospital more frequently (adjusted RR 1.81, 95\% CI 1.41–2.32) and were more likely to require emergency admission (adjusted RR 1.93, 95\% CI 1.35–2.77).

Interpretation
Despite the widespread distribution of guidelines for asthma pharmacotherapy, inappropriate use of asthma medications persists (specifically excessive use of inhaled short-acting β-agonists combined with underuse of inhaled corticosteroids). Not only are patients who use medication inappropriately at higher risk for fatal or near-fatal asthma attacks, but, as shown in this study, they use significantly more health care resources than patients with appropriate medication use.},

Asthma guidelines emphasize both maintaining current control and reducing future risk, but the relationship between these 2 targets is not well understood.
Objective
This retrospective analysis of 5 budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy (Symbicort SMART Turbuhaler∗

Methods
The percentage of patients with Global Initiative for Asthma–defined controlled asthma over time was assessed for budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy versus the 3 maintenance therapies; higher dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), same dose ICS/long-acting β2-agonist (LABA), and higher dose ICS/LABA plus short-acting β2-agonist. The relationship between baseline ACQ-5 and exacerbations was investigated. A Markov analysis examined the transitional probability of change in control status throughout the studies.
Results
The percentage of patients achieving asthma control increased with time, irrespective of treatment; the percentage Controlled/Partly Controlled at study end was at least similar to budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy versus the 3 maintenance therapies: higher dose ICS (56\% vs 45\%), same dose ICS/LABA (56\% vs 53\%), and higher dose ICS/LABA (54\% vs 54\%). Baseline ACQ-5 score correlated positively with exacerbation rates. A Controlled or Partly Controlled week predicted at least Partly Controlled asthma the following week (≥80\% probability). The better the control, the lower the risk of an Uncontrolled week. The probability of an exacerbation was related to current state and was lower with budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy.
Conclusions
Current control predicts future risk of instability and exacerbations. Budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy reduces exacerbations versus comparators and achieves at least similar control.},

	abstract = {Context 
There is limited information that accounts for comorbidity on the impact of role disability associated with a wide range of mental and physical disorders in population-based samples.Objective
To estimate the comparative effects of common mental and physical conditions on role disability in the general population using a novel method that accounts for comorbidity.Design
Direct interviews about physical and mental conditions during the past year.Setting
The National Comorbidity Survey Replication, a nationally representative series of face-to-face interviews.Patients
A nationally representative sample of adults living in households (N = 5962 respondents, 18 years and older).Main Outcome Measure
Disability in major life roles was assessed with the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule. Simulations that allow for complex interactions among conditions were used to estimate the conditions' effects on disability days, when respondents were completely unable to carry out their usual daily activities because of problems with mental or physical health, in the past 12 months.Results
An estimated 53.4\% of US adults have 1 or more of the mental or physical conditions assessed in the survey. These respondents report an average 32.1 more role-disability days in the past year than demographically matched controls, equivalent to nearly 3.6 billion days of role disability in the population. Musculoskeletal disorders and major depression had the greatest effects on disability days. Mental conditions accounted for more than half as many disability days as all physical conditions at the population level. Associations of specific conditions with disability decreased substantially after controlling for comorbidity, suggesting that prior studies, which generally did not control for comorbidity, overestimated disease-specific effects.Conclusion
The staggering amount of health-related disability associated with mental and physical conditions should be considered in establishing priorities for the allocation of health care and research resources.},

	volume = {57},
	issn = {0300-8932},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), an indicator of comorbidity, has been used as an adjusting variable in multivariate models. Because of its prognostic value per se for cardiovascular complications after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we sought to determine the predictive value of the CCI for all-cause mortality and recurrent AMI 30 days and 1 year after the index event.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: We analyzed 1035 consecutive patients admitted with the diagnosis of AMI (ST elevation=508 and non-ST elevation=527). The composite endpoint was determined after 30 days (13.9\%) and 1 year (26.3\%) of follow-up. The CCI was calculated on admission, and other variables with prognostic value were also recorded. CCI was stratified in 4 categories: 1: CCI=0 (control), 2: CCI=1, 3: CCI=2,4: CCI{\textgreater} or =3. Cox proportional risks analysis was used for the multivariate analysis, and the C-statistic was calculated to assess the discriminative power of the models.
RESULTS: Hazard ratios (95\% CI) estimated for each category of CCI were: 2=1.69 (1.10-2.59), 3=1.78 (1.08-2.92) and 4=1.57 (0.87-2.83) at 30 days; 2=1.62 (1.18-2.23), 3=2.00 (1.39-2.89) and 4=2.24 (1.50-3.36) at 1 year. Comparisons with the C-statistic between the nested multivariate models (with and without CCI) yielded values of 0.765 vs 0.750 after 30 days, and 0.751 vs 0.735 after 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that CCI is an independent predictor of mortality or recurrent AMI 30 days and 1 year after the index AMI.},

	abstract = {Five to ten percent of asthma cases are poorly controlled chronically and refractory to treatment, and these severe cases account for disproportionate asthma-associated morbidity, mortality, and health care utilization. While persons with severe asthma tend to have more airway obstruction, it is not known whether they represent the severe tail of a unimodal asthma population, or a severe asthma phenotype. We hypothesized that severe asthma has a characteristic physiology of airway obstruction, and we evaluated spirometry, lung volumes, and reversibility during a stable interval in 287 severe and 382 nonsevere asthma subjects from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Severe Asthma Research Program. We partitioned airway obstruction into components of air trapping [indicated by forced vital capacity (FVC)] and airflow limitation [indicated by forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1))/FVC]. Severe asthma had prominent air trapping, evident as reduced FVC over the entire range of FEV(1)/FVC. This pattern was confirmed with measures of residual lung volume/total lung capacity (TLC) in a subgroup. In contrast, nonsevere asthma did not exhibit prominent air trapping, even at FEV(1)/FVC {\textless}75\% predicted. Air trapping also was associated with increases in TLC and functional reserve capacity. After maximal bronchodilation, FEV(1) reversed similarly from baseline in severe and nonsevere asthma, but the severe asthma classification was an independent predictor of residual reduction in FEV(1) after maximal bronchodilation. An increase in FVC accounted for most of the reversal of FEV(1) when baseline FEV(1) was {\textless}60\% predicted. We conclude that air trapping is a characteristic feature of the severe asthma population, suggesting that there is a pathological process associated with severe asthma that makes airways more vulnerable to this component.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe asthma causes the majority of asthma morbidity. Understanding mechanisms that contribute to the development of severe disease is important.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of the Severe Asthma Research Program is to identify and characterize subjects with severe asthma to understand pathophysiologic mechanisms in severe asthma.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive phenotypic characterization (questionnaires, atopy and pulmonary function testing, phlebotomy, exhaled nitric oxide) in subjects with severe and not severe asthma.
RESULTS: A total of 438 subjects with asthma were studied (204 severe, 70 moderate, 164 mild). Severe subjects with asthma were older with longer disease duration (P {\textless} .0001), more daily symptoms, intense urgent health care utilization, sinusitis, and pneumonia (P {\textless} or = .0001). Lung function was lower in severe asthma with marked bronchodilator reversibility (P {\textless} .001). The severe group had less atopy by skin tests (P = .0007), but blood eosinophils, IgE, and exhaled nitric oxide levels did not differentiate disease severity. A reduced FEV(1), history of pneumonia, and fewer positive skin tests were risk factors for severe disease. Early disease onset (age {\textless} 12 years) in severe asthma was associated with longer disease duration (P {\textless} .0001) and more urgent health care, especially intensive care (P = .002). Later disease onset (age {\textgreater} or = 12 years) was associated with lower lung function and sinopulmonary infections (P {\textless} or = .02).
CONCLUSION: Severe asthma is characterized by abnormal lung function that is responsive to bronchodilators, a history of sinopulmonary infections, persistent symptoms, and increased health care utilization.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Lung function abnormalities in severe asthma are reversible in most patients, and pneumonia is a risk factor for the development of severe disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common causes of mortality and a major contributor to morbidity. Longitudinal clinical practice data yielding information on the characteristics of the disease, its natural course, and management are limited.
AIMS: To investigate and describe the COPD population from a nationwide perspective during an 11-year period (1999-2009) with a focus on management, co-morbidity, and mortality.
METHODS: This observational retrospective epidemiological study linked electronic medical records data from patients with COPD in primary care to mandatory Swedish hospital, drug and Cause of Death registry data from 1999 to 2009 (PATHOS).
RESULTS: A total of 21,361 patients with a COPD diagnosis were included (mean age 68.0 years, 53\% females). The proportion of patients diagnosed in primary care increased from 59\% in 1999 to 81\% in 2009 and the mean age at diagnosis decreased from 73 to 66 years. The number of exacerbations decreased from 3.0 to 1.3 and COPD-related hospitalisations decreased from 1.02 to 0.20 per patient per year. Prescriptions of long-acting muscarinic antagonists and fixed combinations of inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β2-agonist inhalers increased from 0\% to 36\% and 37\%, respectively. The most common co-morbidities were hypertension, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, and diabetes. Overall life expectancy was 8.3±6.8 years shorter in patients with COPD than in the general population, and all- cause mortality was 3.5 times higher.
CONCLUSIONS: Management of COPD in Sweden has improved during the 11-year study period. Despite this, patients with COPD have a substantially reduced life expectancy than the general population.},

	abstract = {AIM: Cardiovascular disease (CV) is the second leading cause of morbidity and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with cardiovascular disease, and its risk factors are common to other atherosclerotic diseases. The objective is to determine the prevalence of PAD in a population of patients with COPD using the ankle / brachial index (ABI) and to investigate the relationship between PAD and lung disease severity.
METHODS: In a prospective cross-sectional study, 246 patients with COPD were recruited. Patients were enrolled consecutively according to their admission to Povisa hospital from September 1, 2008, until March 1, 2010, and were assessed by clinical history, spirometry and ABI. The COPD severity was graded by GOLD criteria in spirometry.
RESULTS: Overall, 84 patients (36.8\%) had abnormal ABI results and 59 (70.2\%) were asymptomatic for PAD. COPD patients with PAD had a higher prevalence of moderate to severe COPD (61.9\% vs. 41.7\%, P=0.004), lower mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) values (46.7\% ± 15 vs. 52.3±14\%, P=0.001) and a higher prevalence of hypertension (69\% vs. 54.3\%, P=0.03) and previous cardiovascular disease (34.5\% vs. 21.3\%, P=0.03).
CONCLUSION: There was a high prevalence of asymptomatic PAD in the COPD patients we examined. Abnormal ABI results were associated with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and more severe lung disease. The diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease in COPD is important because this is an entity that limits the patient's physical activity and impairs their quality of life in addition to turn it into a high cardiovascular risk patient that requiring additional therapeutic measures.},

	abstract = {Background
Myocardial infarction (MI) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are frequent and share common risk factors. Yet, studies on MI patients reported limited and conflicting results on the prevalence of COPD, its impact on outcome, and how these may have changed over time. We examined, in a geographically defined community, the prevalence of COPD in patients with MI, its impact on mortality, and how these associations changed over time.

Methods
Residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota who experienced an MI meeting standardized criteria from 1979 to 2007 were included (3438, 42\% women, mean age 68±15 years). COPD was ascertained from the medical records.

Results
Of 3438 patients, 415 (12\%) had COPD. During the study, COPD prevalence increased from 7\% in 1979–1985 to 15\% in 2000–2007, p{\textless}0.001. Survival was worse among patients with COPD (5 years survival rate 46\% \{95\%CI 41\% to 52\%\} versus 68\% \{95\%CI 66\% to 70\%\} in those without COPD (p{\textless}0.01). The association between COPD and death was independent of age and risk factors (adjusted HR 1.30, 95\%CI 1.10 to1.54; p {\textless}0.01) and did not change over time.

Conclusions
In a large community of patients with MI, the prevalence of COPD increased over time and was associated with a marked increased risk of death after MI independently of age, risk factors, and comorbidity. This underscores the importance of this condition and the need to optimize care for these high-risk patients.},

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. Recent studies investigated the impact of comorbidities on the survival in COPD, but most of them lacked a referent group of comorbidity-matched, nonobstructed individuals.We examined the 10-year mortality in a sample of 200 COPD patients and 201 nonobstructed controls. They were part of a larger cohort enrolled in a European case-control study aimed at assessing genetic susceptibility to COPD. By design, the COPD group included patients with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≤70\% predicted. Cases and controls were matched on age, sex, and cumulative smoking history, and shared a nearly identical prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. We estimated the hazard of death with Cox regression and percentiles of survival with Laplace regression. COPD was the main exposure variable of interest. Five comorbidities (hypertension, coronary artery disease, prior myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure, and diabetes) were included as covariates in multiple regression models.The all-cause mortality rate was significantly higher in cases than in controls (43\% vs 16\%, P {\textless} 0.001). The unadjusted hazard of death for COPD was 3-fold higher than the referent category (P {\textless} 0.001), and remained nearly unchanged after introducing the 5 comorbidities in multiple regression. Patients with COPD had significantly shorter survival percentiles than comorbidity-matched controls (P {\textless} 0.001). Notably, 15\% of the nonobstructed controls died by 10.3 years into the study; the same proportion of COPD patients had died some 6 years earlier, at 4.6 years.In a separate analysis, we split the whole sample into 2 groups based on the lower tertile of FEV1 and carbon monoxide lung diffusing capacity (DLCO). The hazard of death for COPD patients with low FEV1 and DLCO was nearly 3.5-fold higher than in all the others (P {\textless} 0.001), and decreased only slightly after introducing age and chronic heart failure as relevant covariates.COPD is a strong predictor of reduced survival independently of coexisting cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. Efforts should be made to identify patients at risk and to ensure adherence to prescribed therapeutic regimens.},

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, yet the exact pathophysiological links remain unclear. Whether the presence and severity of COPD are associated with atrial or ventricular arrhythmias recorded on continuous electrocardiographic monitoring is unknown. We identified consecutive adult patients who underwent clinically indicated pulmonary function testing as well as 24-hour Holter monitoring at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, from 2000 to 2009. Demographic data and relevant co-morbidities were gathered from the electronic medical record; severity of COPD was classified according to the GOLD classification, and arrhythmias were classified in concordance with the current clinical guidelines. From 7,441 patients who were included (age 64±16 years, 49\% woman, 92\% Caucasian), COPD was diagnosed in 3,121 (41.9\%). Compared with those without COPD, the presence and severity of COPD were associated with increased likelihood of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF/AFL; 23.3\% vs 11.0\%, respectively, p{\textless}0.0001), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT; 13.0\% vs 5.9\%, respectively, p{\textless}0.0001), and sustained ventricular tachycardia (0.9\% vs 1.6\%, respectively, p{\textless}0.0001). COPD remained a significant predictor of AF/AFL and NSVT (p{\textless}0.0001 and p{\textless}0.0001, respectively) after adjusting for age, gender, tobacco use, obesity, hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, diabetes, anemia, cancer, chronic kidney disease, and rate/rhythm control medications. In conclusion, the independent association between the presence and severity of COPD and arrhythmias (AF/AFL and NSVT) provides further insight into the markedly increased cardiovascular mortality of patients with COPD. Further studies should explore which anti-arrhythmic strategies would best apply to the patients with COPD.},

	abstract = {COPD is associated with a relevant burden of disease and a high mortality worldwide. Only recently, the importance of comorbidities of COPD has been recognized. Studies postulated an association with inflammatory conditions potentially sharing pathogenic pathways and worsening overall prognosis. More evidence is required to estimate the role of comorbidities of COPD. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence and clustering of comorbidities associated with COPD, and to estimate their impact on clinically relevant outcomes. In this population-based case-control study, a nation-wide database provided by the Swiss Federal Office for Statistics enclosing every hospital entry covering the years 2002-2010 (n = 12'888'075) was analyzed using MySQL and R statistical software. Statistical methods included non-parametric hypothesis testing by means of Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test, as well as linear models with generalized estimating equation to account for intra-patient variability. Exploratory multivariate approaches were also used for the identification of clusters of comorbidities in COPD patients. In 2.6\% (6.3\% in patients aged {\textgreater}70 years) of all hospitalization cases an active diagnosis of COPD was recorded. In 21\% of these cases, COPD was the main reason for hospitalization. Patients with a diagnosis of COPD had more comorbidities (7 [IQR 4-9] vs. 3 [IQR 1-6]; [Formula: see text]), were more frequently rehospitalized (annual hospitalization rate 0.33 [IQR 0.20-0.67] vs. 0.25 [IQR 0.14-0.43]/year; [Formula: see text]), had a longer hospital stay (9 [IQR 4-15] vs. 5 [IQR 2-11] days; [Formula: see text]), and had higher in-hospital mortality (5.9\% [95\% CI 5.8\%-5.9\%] vs. 3.4\% [95\% CI 3.3\%-3.5\%]; [Formula: see text]) compared to matched controls. A set of comorbidities was associated with worse outcome. We could identify COPD-related clusters of COPD-comorbidities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and atherosclerotic vascular disease share several etiopathogenic factors.
PURPOSE: To compare the prevalence of self-reported cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (CCVD) between COPD and non-COPD subjects using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Among subjects without pre-existent CCVD, the short-term and lifetime risks of future CCVD were also compared between the two groups.
METHODS: Pooled NHANES 2007-2010 data were analyzed in May 2012 and April 2013. Based on predicted Framingham risk, subjects without self-reported CCVD were classified as follows: high short-term risk, low short-term/high lifetime risk, and low short-term/low lifetime risk for future CCVD.
RESULTS: Estimated self-reported CCVD prevalence was 20.0\% and 7.4\% in COPD and non-COPD groups, respectively (p{\textless}0.001). On multivariable analysis, COPD was an independent risk factor for prevalent self-reported CCVD (prevalence ratio=1.4, 95\% CI=1.1, 1.8). Among subjects without CCVD, there were significant differences in predicted future CCVD risk between the two groups. In the non-COPD group, prevalence of high short-term risk, low short-term/high lifetime risk, and low short-term/low lifetime risk was 18.9\%, 62.7\%, and 18.4\%, respectively. In the COPD group, corresponding prevalence estimates were 35.8\%, 53.2\%, and 11.1\%, respectively. Men and women had significantly different risk factor profiles for future CCVD.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of self-reported CCVD was significantly higher in subjects with COPD than in those without COPD. Among subjects without pre-existent CCVD, the risk of future CCVD was significantly higher in the COPD group than in the non-COPD group.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examine the relationship between health insurance status and access to care among low-income persons 65 years of age and under, taking into account their social demographic characteristics and health care needs. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING. Study groups consist of the subsamples of persons with incomes between 100 and 150 percent of the federal poverty level and those below the federal poverty level interviewed in the 1983, 1984, and 1986 Health Interview Surveys (HIS) of the National Center for Health Statistics. Sample sizes range from about 6,000 to 11,000 depending on the proportion of each study group administered the insurance supplement. STUDY DESIGN. Annual visits and whether hospitalized during a year are used as measures of access to medical care. The analysis consists of identifying predictors of use of services (i.e., health status and social characteristics) and, taking them into account, examining the relationship of insurance status to access to care. This was first undertaken on the 1983 survey; the models obtained then are replicated on the other two years of data. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS. The HIS utilizes in-person interviews to gather health and medical history information from a stratified random sample of the U.S. population. Data were obtained through public use tapes distributed by the National Center for Health Statistics. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Results are consistent for all three years among persons in poverty. Being covered by Medicaid, in contrast to having private insurance or being without health insurance, is related to use of both ambulatory care and hospital care. The access differences for persons in poverty, regardless of their vulnerability or "risk" of requiring medical care, are marked and generally statistically significant. Among the near-poor the same findings occur, although the differences are less sharp and less often statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS. The most obvious explanation is that the poor, and to a considerable extent the near-poor, have limited access because of copayments and deductibles that are typically part of private insurance coverage. The findings raise policy questions regarding the utility of either "play or pay" employer-provided insurance or income tax deductions to increase access.},

	abstract = {There are large differences in health outcomes by socioeconomic status (SES) that cannot be explained fully by traditional arguments, such as access to care or poor health behaviors. We consider a different explanation—better self-management of disease by the more educated. We examine differences by education in treatment adherence among patients with two illnesses, diabetes and HIV, and then assess the subsequent impact of differential adherence on health status. One unique component of this research is that for diabetes we combine two different surveys—one cohort study and one randomized clinical trial—that are usually used exclusively by either biomedical or/and social scientists separately. For both illnesses, we find significant effects of adherence that are much stronger among patients with high SES. After controlling for other factors, more educated HIV+ patients are more likely to adhere to therapy, and this adherence made them experience improvements in their self-reported general health. Similarly, among diabetics, the less educated were much more likely to switch treatment, which led to worsening general health. In the randomized trial setting, intensive treatment regimens that compensated for poor adherence led to better improvements in glycemic control for the less educated. Among two distinct chronic illnesses, the ability to maintain a better health regimen is an important independent determinant of subsequent health outcomes. This finding is robust across clinical trial and population-based settings. Because this ability varies by schooling, self-maintenance is an important reason for the steep SES gradient in health outcomes.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The term "regression dilution" describes the dilution/attenuation in a regression coefficient that occurs when a single measured value of a covariate is used instead of the usual or average value over a period of time. This paper reviews the current knowledge concerning a simple method of adjusting for regression dilution in single and multiple covariate situations and illustrates the adjustment procedure.
METHODS: Formulation of the regression dilution problem as a measurement error problem allows existing measurement error theory to be applied to developing methods of adjustment for regression dilution. This theory leads to a precise method of adjustment for linear regression and approximate methods for logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression. The method involves obtaining the naive estimates of coefficients by assuming that covariates are not measured with error, and then adjusting these coefficients using reliability estimates for the covariates. Methods for estimating the reliability of covariates from the reliability and main study data and a method for the calculation of standard errors and confidence intervals for adjusted coefficients are described.
RESULTS: An illustration involving logistic regression analysis of risk factors for death from cardiovascular disease based on cohort and reliability data from the Busselton Health Study shows that the different methods for estimating the adjustment factors give very similar adjusted estimates of coefficients, that univariate adjustment procedures may lead to inappropriate adjustments in multiple covariate situations, whether or not other covariates have intra-individual variation, and when the reliability study is moderate to large, the precision of the estimates of reliability coefficients has little impact on the standard errors of adjusted regression coefficients.
CONCLUSIONS: The simple method of adjusting regression coefficients for "regression dilution" that arises out of measurement error theory is applicable to many epidemiological settings and is easily implemented. The choice of method to estimate the reliability coefficient has little impact on the results. The practice of applying univariate adjustments in multiple covariate situations is not recommended.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Interest in the effects of neighbourhood or local area social characteristics on health has increased in recent years, but to date the existing evidence has not been systematically reviewed. Multilevel or contextual analyses of social factors and health represent a possible reconciliation between two divergent epidemiological paradigms-individual risk factor epidemiology and an ecological approach.
DATA SOURCES: Keyword searching of Index Medicus (Medline) and additional references from retrieved articles.
STUDY SELECTION: All original studies of the effect of local area social characteristics on individual health outcomes, adjusted for individual socioeconomic status, published in English before 1 June 1998 and focused on populations in developed countries.
DATA SYNTHESIS: The methodological challenges posed by the design and interpretation of multilevel studies of local area effects are discussed and results summarised with reference to type of health outcome. All but two of the 25 reviewed studies reported a statistically significant association between at least one measure of social environment and a health outcome (contextual effect), after adjusting for individual level socioeconomic status (compositional effect). Contextual effects were generally modest and much smaller than compositional effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for modest neighbourhood effects on health is fairly consistent despite heterogeneity of study designs, substitution of local area measures for neighbourhood measures and probable measurement error. By drawing public health attention to the health risks associated with the social structure and ecology of neighbourhoods, innovative approaches to community level interventions may ensue.},

For each use measure, we estimated the policy effect as the difference between observed use in the postpolicy period and predicted use obtained from the prepolicy period. In total, over the 2.5-year period after public coverage, tiotropium use increased by 24.4\% more than predicted (95\% confidence interval [CI] 23.9\%–24.8\%). Visits to physicians were unchanged, but there were between 596 and 948 more emergency admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and between 582 and 1940 more hospital admissions of any kind than were predicted from prepolicy data. Total cost of inhaled IAC medications increased slightly more than predicted, by between an additional CDN\$1.30 million and CDN\$1.71 million, but total out-of-pocket spending by patients on IAC medications was reduced by between CDN\$2.83 million and CDN\$3.11 million because of public coverage. Hospital costs were between CDN\$3.88 million and CDN\$12.93 million greater than anticipated based on prepolicy data. Public drug plan coverage for tiotropium in British Columbia reduced out-of-pocket costs for patients and their private insurers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, multicentre study was carried out on COPD patients admitted to 25 Hospital Centres as a result of an exacerbation from October-December 2002. Following discharge, a 6-month follow-up was performed in each patient via three bi-monthly telephone interviews with a questionnaire administered by an investigator clinician.
RESULTS: 570 patients were eligible for data processing, mean age 70.6 years (+/- 9.5 standard deviation, SD), males 69.2\%. According to GOLD, severity stratification was as follows: moderate 36.4\%; severe 31.3\%; very severe 32.3\%. 282 patients experienced at least one exacerbation at follow up, 42\% of exacerbations requiring hospitalisation. No significant association was seen between exacerbations and GOLD stage or co-morbidities or treatments except LTOT. Conversely, COPD functional severity influenced hospitalisations very significantly, with relative risks 2.6 (95\% Confidence Interval, CI 1.8-3.8) and 2.0 (CI 1.3-2.8) (GOLD very severe versus moderate and severe, respectively), and 1.3 (CI 0.85-2.1) (GOLD severe versus moderate). Hospitalisations were also significantly associated with treatments denoting more severe conditions (oral corticosteroids, oral theophylline, and LTOT).
CONCLUSIONS: Severity stratification of COPD patients according to respiratory function classes as outlined in GOLD guidelines and need for LTOT are confirmed as important predictors of hospitalisation for an exacerbation.},

	abstract = {Background
Care for many chronic health conditions is delivered by both specialists and generalists. Differences in patients’ quality of care and management between generalists and specialists have been well documented for asthma, whereas a few studies for COPD reported no differences.

Objective
The objective of this study is to compare consistency with Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines, as well as rate, health care utilization, and hospital outcomes of severe acute exacerbation (AE) of COPD patients managed by pulmonologists and internists.

Materials and methods
This is a 12-month prospective, comparative observational study among 208 COPD patients who were regularly managed by pulmonologists (Group A) and internists (Group B). Clinical data, health care utilization, and hospital outcomes of the two groups were statistically compared.

Results
Out of 208 enrolled patients, 137 (Group A) and 71 (Group B) were managed by pulmonologists and internists, respectively. Pharmacological treatment corresponding to disease severity stages between the two groups was not statistically different. Group A received care consistent with guidelines in terms of annual influenza vaccination (31.4\% vs 9.9\%, P{\textless}0.001) and pulmonary rehabilitation (24.1\% vs 0\%, P{\textless}0.001) greater than Group B. Group A had reduced rates (12.4\% vs 23.9\%, P=0.033) and numbers of severe AE (0.20±0.63 person-years vs 0.41±0.80 person-years, P=0.029). Among patients with severe AE requiring mechanical ventilation, Group A had reduced mechanical ventilator duration (1.5 [1–7] days vs 5 [3–29] days, P=0.005), hospital length of stay (3.5 [1–20] days vs 16 [6–29] days, P=0.012), and total hospital cost (\$863 [247–2,496] vs \$2,095 [763–6,792], P=0.049) as compared with Group B.

Conclusion
This study demonstrated that pulmonologists followed national COPD guidelines more closely than internists. The rates and frequencies of severe AE were significantly lower in patients managed by pulmonologists, and length of hospital stay and cost were significantly lower among the patients with severe AE who required mechanical ventilation.},

The relationship between prior health care utilization and respiratory medication prescriptions in an unselected population of patients with COPD is not known.

Methods:
We determined the prescribed respiratory medications and respiratory and nonrespiratory health care encounters in 523 Veterans with COPD at the Cincinnati Veterans Affairs Medical Center between 2000 and 2005. Prescribed treatments were compared with the GOLD guidelines and each patient was classified as receiving less medications than recommended in the guidelines ({\textless}G), medications according to the guidelines (=G), or more medications than recommended ({\textgreater}G).

	abstract = {Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death among US adults and is projected to be the third by 2020. In anticipation of the increasing burden imposed on healthcare systems and payers by patients with COPD, a means of identifying COPD patients who incur higher healthcare utilization and costs is needed.

Methods
This retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of US managed care administrative claims data describes a practical way to identify COPD patients. We analyze 7.79 million members for potential inclusion in the COPD cohort, who were continuously eligible during a 1-year study period. A younger commercial population (7.7 million) is compared with an older Medicare population (0.115 million). We outline a novel approach to stratifying COPD patients using "complexity" of illness, based on occurrence of claims for given comorbid conditions. Additionally, a unique algorithm was developed to identify and stratify COPD exacerbations using claims data.

Results
A total of 42,565 commercial (median age 56 years; 51.4\% female) and 8507 Medicare patients (median 75 years; 53.1\% female) were identified as having COPD. Important differences were observed in comorbidities between the younger commercial versus the older Medicare population. Stratifying by complexity, 45.0\%, 33.6\%, and 21.4\% of commercial patients and 36.6\%, 35.8\%, and 27.6\% of older patients were low, moderate, and high, respectively. A higher proportion of patients with high complexity disease experienced multiple (≥2) exacerbations (61.7\% commercial; 49.0\% Medicare) than patients with moderate- (56.9\%; 41.6\%), or low-complexity disease (33.4\%; 20.5\%). Utilization of healthcare services also increased with an increase in complexity.

Conclusion
In patients with COPD identified from Medicare or commercial claims data, there is a relationship between complexity as determined by pulmonary and non-pulmonary comorbid conditions and the prevalence of exacerbations and utilization of healthcare services. Identification of COPD patients at highest risk of exacerbations using complexity stratification may facilitate improved disease management by targeting those most in need of treatment.},

	abstract = {Background
In many patients with mild asthma, the low frequency of symptoms and the episodic nature of exacerbations make adherence to regular maintenance treatment difficult. This often leads to over-reliance on short-acting β2-agonist (SABA) reliever medication and under-treatment of the underlying inflammation, with poor control of asthma symptoms and increased risk of exacerbations. The use of budesonide/formoterol ‘as needed’ in response to symptoms may represent an alternative treatment option for patients with mild asthma.

Methods/design
The SYmbicort Given as needed in Mild Asthma (SYGMA) programme consists of two 52-week, double-blind, randomised, multicentre, parallel-group, phase 3 trials of patients aged 12 years and older with a clinical diagnosis of asthma for at least 6 months, who would qualify for treatment with regular inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). SYGMA1 aims to recruit 3750 patients who will be randomised to placebo twice daily (bid) plus as-needed budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 μg, placebo bid plus as-needed terbutaline 0.4 mg, or budesonide 200 μg bid plus as-needed terbutaline 0.4 mg. The primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of as-needed budesonide/formoterol over as-needed terbutaline for asthma control, as measured by well-controlled asthma weeks; a secondary objective is to establish the noninferiority of as-needed budesonide/formoterol versus maintenance budesonide plus as-needed terbutaline using the same outcome measure. SYGMA2 aims to recruit 4114 patients who will be randomised to placebo bid plus as-needed budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 μg, or budesonide 200 μg bid plus as-needed terbutaline 0.4 mg. The primary objective is to demonstrate the noninferiority of as-needed budesonide/formoterol over budesonide bid plus as-needed terbutaline as measured by the annualised severe exacerbation rate. In both studies, use of all blinded study inhalers will be recorded electronically using Turbuhaler® Usage Monitors.

Discussion
Given the known risks of mild asthma, and known poor adherence with regular inhaled corticosteroids, the results of the SYGMA programme will help to determine the efficacy and safety of as-needed budesonide/formoterol therapy in mild asthma. Patient recruitment is complete, and completion of the phase 3 studies is planned in 2017.

SYGMA1 aims to recruit 3750 patients who will be randomised to placebo twice daily (bid) plus as-needed budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 μg, placebo bid plus as-needed terbutaline 0.4 mg, or budesonide 200 μg bid plus as-needed terbutaline 0.4 mg. The primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of as-needed budesonide/formoterol over as-needed terbutaline for asthma control, as measured by well-controlled asthma weeks; a secondary objective is to establish the noninferiority of as-needed budesonide/formoterol versus maintenance budesonide plus as-needed terbutaline using the same outcome measure. SYGMA2 aims to recruit 4114 patients who will be randomised to placebo bid plus as-needed budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 μg, or budesonide 200 μg bid plus as-needed terbutaline 0.4 mg. The primary objective is to demonstrate the noninferiority of as-needed budesonide/formoterol over budesonide bid plus as-needed terbutaline as measured by the annualised severe exacerbation rate. In both studies, use of all blinded study inhalers will be recorded electronically using Turbuhaler® Usage Monitors.

Discussion
Given the known risks of mild asthma, and known poor adherence with regular inhaled corticosteroids, the results of the SYGMA programme will help to determine the efficacy and safety of as-needed budesonide/formoterol therapy in mild asthma. Patient recruitment is complete, and completion of the phase 3 studies is planned in 2017.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that the use of leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) in addition to inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) in asthmatic patients provides comparable benefits to the addition of long-acting β-agonists (LABAs) to ICSs.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare, in a unified framework, adherence, outcomes, and costs associated with ICS+LTRA versus ICS+LABA as step-up therapies for asthma.
METHODS: Using the administrative databases of British Columbia, Canada (years 1997-2007), we created a propensity score-matched sample of asthmatic patients (12-45 years old) receiving ICS+LTRA therapy versus ICS+LABA therapy after a period of monotherapy with an ICS. We compared the outcomes using 2 analyses: an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis that followed subjects for a fixed period of 2 years and an uninterrupted treatment analysis that followed subjects for as long as they continuously dispensed their index medications.
RESULTS: The matched cohort consisted of 1032 subjects in each group (mean age at entry, 27.4 years; 52.5\% female). Adherence, which was defined as the proportion of days covered, was higher in the ICS+LABA group compared with the ICS+LTRA group. In both the ITT and uninterrupted treatment analyses, use of ICS+LTRA therapy was associated with more asthma-related outpatient visits, asthma-related medication dispensations, and dispensation of reliever medications. Dispensation of oral corticosteroids and rate of asthma exacerbations were higher in the ICS+LTRA group in the uninterrupted treatment analysis but not in the ITT analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world clinical setting subjects were more adherent to ICS+LABA therapy than ICS+LTRA therapy. ICS+LABA therapy seems to be more effective than ICS+LTRA therapy in the management of asthma, regardless of adherence.},

	abstract = {The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert Panel II recommended a stepped care pharmacotherapy approach to asthma treatment based on an objective assessment of asthma severity using daytime symptoms, nocturnal symptoms, and physiologic lung function. The worst grade of the individual variables determines overall asthma severity. With this approach, patterns of asthma severity categorization might vary among individual variables; one variable might have a predominant effect on overall categorization. During the run-in, pretreatment phase of five controlled clinical trials, data from 744 inhaled steroid nonusers and 685 inhaled steroid users on asthma control were collected and asthma severity categorized. In inhaled steroid nonusers nocturnal symptoms classified the majority of patients as severe, persistent, but wheeze classified 27.3\% of patients as mild, intermittent and 25.7\% as mild, persistent. If the worst grade from the four asthma symptoms was used for severity grading, most patients were categorized as severe, persistent. beta-Agonist use and FEV(1) classified most as moderate, persistent. There was poor correlation between variables in severity categorization. Severity grading for European patients was similar to that for U.S. patients. Applying the Expert Panel II recommended method for asthma severity categorization to a large data set illustrates that a single variable, nocturnal symptoms, determined to a large extent overall categorization. Development of a validated method for asthma severity categorization is essential for using a stepped care approach to asthma pharmacotherapy.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To characterize the relationship between symptoms and the degree of airway obstruction as determined by the FEV1 and peak expiratory flow (PEF) in a cohort of adult patients attending a university-based urban asthma clinic.
DESIGN: Each of six current asthma symptoms, including cough, dyspnea, wheeze, chest tightness, sputum production, and nocturnal awakening was rated by patients on a 0 (none) to 4 (constant) scale at initial and first follow-up clinic evaluations. Spirometry and PEF were measured at the initial clinic visit and PEF was measured at all follow-up visits.
PATIENTS: Sixty-seven adult patients with chronic asthma.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Asthma symptoms did not correlate with the degree of airway obstruction as determined by the FEV1 (percent predicted FEV1 vs total symptoms: r=0.143; p=0.263; n=70) and only correlated poorly with PEF (percent predicted PEF vs total symptoms: r=0.384; p=0.0029; n=58).

Independent observers extracted data regarding annualized asthma incidence from studies meeting predetermined criteria, within defined categories of normal weight (BMI {\textless} 25), overweight (BMI, 25–29.9), and obesity (BMI ⩾ 30). Data were analyzed by inverse-variance–weighted, random-effects meta-analysis. Stratified analysis between BMI categories and within sex was performed.Results: Seven studies (n = 333,102 subjects) met inclusion criteria. Compared with normal weight, overweight and obesity (BMI ⩾ 25) conferred increased odds of incident asthma, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.51 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.27–1.80). A dose–response effect of elevated BMI on asthma incidence was observed; the OR for incident asthma for normal-weight versus overweight subjects was 1.38 (95\% CI, 1.17–1.62) and was further elevated for normal weight versus obesity (OR, 1.92; 95\% CI, 1.43–2.59; p {\textless} 0.0001 for the trend). A similar increase in the OR of incident asthma due to overweight and obesity was observed in men (OR, 1.46; 95\% CI, 1.05–2.02) and women (OR, 1.68; 95\% CI, 1.45–1.94; p = 0.232 for the comparison).Conclusions: Overweight and obesity are associated with a dose-dependent increase in the odds of incident asthma in men and women, suggesting asthma incidence could be reduced by interventions targeting overweight and obesity.},

	issn = {1469-493X},
	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD005307.pub2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Consensus statements recommend the addition of long-acting inhaled ss2-agonists (LABA) only in asthmatic patients who are inadequately controlled on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). It is not uncommon for some patients to be commenced on ICS and LABA together as initial therapy.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of combining inhaled corticosteroids with long-acting ss2-agonists (ICS+LABA) with inhaled corticosteroids alone (ICS alone) in steroid-naive children and adults with persistent asthma. We assessed two protocols: (1) LABA + ICS versus a similar dose of ICS (comparison 1) and (2) LABA + ICS versus a higher dose of ICS (comparison 2).
SEARCH STRATEGY: We identified randomised controlled trials through electronic database searches (May 2008).
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing ICS + LABA with ICS alone in children and adults with asthma who had no inhaled corticosteroids in the preceding 28 days prior to enrolment.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Each author assessed studies independently for risk of bias and extracted data. We obtained confirmation from the trialists when possible. The primary endpoint was rate of patients with one or more asthma exacerbations requiring rescue systemic corticosteroids. Results are expressed as relative risks (RR) for dichotomous data and as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) for continuous data.
MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-eight study comparisons drawn from 27 trials (22 adult; five paediatric) met the review entry criteria (8050 participants). Baseline data from the studies indicated that trial populations had moderate or mild airway obstruction (FEV1{\textgreater}/=65\% predicted), and that they were symptomatic prior to randomisation. In comparison 1, the combination of ICS and LABA was not associated with a significantly lower risk of patients with exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (RR 1.04; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.47) or requiring hospital admissions (RR 0.38; 95\% CI 0.09 to 1.65) compared to a similar dose of ICS alone. The combination of LABA and ICS led to a significantly greater improvement from baseline in FEV1 (0.12 L/sec; 95\% CI 0.07 to 0.17), in symptoms (SMD -0.26; 95\% CI -0.37 to -0.14) and in rescue ss2-agonist use (-0.41 puffs/day; 95\% CI -0.73 to -0.09) compared with a similar dose of ICS alone. There was no significant group difference in the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.15; 95\% CI 0.64 to 2.09), any adverse events (RR 1.02; 95\% CI 0.96 to 1.09), study withdrawals (RR 0.95; 95\% CI 0.82 to 1.11), or withdrawals due to poor asthma control (RR 0.94; 95\% CI 0.63 to 1.41).In comparison 2, the combination of LABA and ICS was associated with a higher risk of patients requiring oral corticosteroids (RR 1.24; 95\% CI 1 to 1.53) and study withdrawal (RR 1.31; 95\% CI 1.07 to 1.59) than a higher dose of ICS alone. For every 100 patients treated over 43 weeks, nine patients using a higher dose ICS compared to 11 (95\% CI 9 to 14) on LABA and ICS suffered one or more exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids. There was a high level of statistical heterogeneity for FEV1 and morning peak flow. There was no statistically significant group difference in the risk of serious adverse events. Due to insufficient data we could not aggregate results for hospital admission, symptoms and other outcomes.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In steroid-naive patients with mild to moderate airway obstruction, the combination of ICS and LABA does not significantly reduce the risk of patients with exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids over that achieved with a similar dose of ICS alone. However, it significantly improves lung function, reduces symptoms and marginally decreases rescue ss2-agonist use. Initiation of a higher dose of ICS is more effective at reducing the risk of exacerbations requiring rescue systemic corticosteroids, and of withdrawals, than combination therapy. Although children appeared to respond similarly to adults, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding combination therapy in steroid-naive children, given the small number of children contributing data.},

Twenty-one young patients with perennial allergic rhinitis and asthma, with documented lower airway hyperresponsiveness (PC20 methacholine {\textless}8 mg/ml), were treated with intranasal aqueous beclomethasone dipropionate and placebo, each given for 4 weeks. Patients recorded rhinitis and asthma symptom scores and monitored peak expiratory flow rates every morning and evening. Patients recorded global assessment of rhinitis and global asthma symptom scores at the beginning and end of each treatment. PC20 methacholine was performed at baseline and at the end of each treatment period. Intranasal beclomethasone dipropionate significantly reduced global rhinitis symptom scores (p = 0.05) after 4 weeks of treatment. Global asthma scores did not change significantly (p = 0.2). Geometric mean PC20 methacholine improved significantly after 4 weeks of intranasal beclomethasone, but not after placebo (p = 0.04). Daily morning and evening rhinitis symptom scores were lower in patients treated with intranasal corticosteroids over the first 4 weeks of treatment, but carryover effect of steroids precluded comparative analysis of the second 4-week block (morning p = 0.06, evening p = 0.03). Morning asthma scores tended to decrease (p = 0.07). Evening asthma scores were significantly decreased at weeks 2 and 3 (p = 0.001, p = 0.02, respectively). No change in peak expiratory flow rate was seen. This study confirms that treatment of inflammation in the upper airways indirectly improves asthma symptoms and decreases bronchial hyperreactivity. Ignoring inflammation in the upper airway may lead to suboptimal results in asthma treatment.},

Allergic rhinitis treatment and asthma-related events (hospitalizations and emergency department visits) were identified. An incidence density ratio (IDR) associated with exposure to allergic rhinitis treatment was calculated. A multivariate Poisson regression was estimated, and the parameter estimates were transformed into IDRs for each explanatory variable. An allergic rhinitis treatment indicator was included in all regressions. Results: The study sample population consisted of 4944 patients with allergic asthma, approximately 73\% of whom were treated for their allergic rhinitis. Asthma-related events occurred more often for the untreated group compared with the treated group, 6.6\% compared with 1.3\%. An IDR of 0.49 for the treatment group (P = .001) indicates that the risk of an asthma-related event for the treated group was about half that for the untreated group. Conclusion: In summary, those who were treated for allergic rhinitis have a significantly lower risk of subsequent asthma-related events (emergency department visits or hospitalizations) than those who were not treated.

	abstract = {Although clinical trials have demonstrated that rhinitis therapy improves subjective and objective measures of asthma, it is uncertain whether treatment of allergic rhinitis significantly affects the frequency of asthma exacerbations. The objective of this study was to determine whether treatment with intranasal corticosteroids and/or second-generation antihistamines is associated with changes in rates of asthma exacerbations resulting in emergency room visits and/or hospitalizations in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis. This was a nested, case-control study. Treatment with either nasal corticosteroids or second-generation antihistamines was associated with a lower risk of asthma-related emergency room treatment and hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.51; 95\% CI, 0.34 to 0.77 and 0.34, 0.18 to 0.62, respectively). Patients who used nasal cortico-steroids had a significantly lower risk of both asthma-related emergency room treatment and hospitalization (adjusted OR, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.62 to 0.91 and 0.56, 0.42 to 0.76, respectively), whereas there was a trend toward lower risk of emergency room treatment and hospitalization in patients who used second-generation antihistamines (adjusted OR, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.62 to 1.26 and 0.68, 0.40 to 1.14, respectively). Combined treatment with both medications was associated with a further lowering of the risk of both emergency room treatment and hospitalization (adjusted OR, 0.37; 95\% CI, 0.19 to 0.73 and 0.22, 0.07 to 0.63). In patients with asthma, treatment of concomitant allergic rhinitis was associated with significant reductions in risk of emergency room treatment and hospitalization for asthma.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although inhaled glucocorticosteroids are recommended for persistent asthma, their long-term effect on recent onset, mild, persistent asthma has yet to be established.
METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind clinical trial in 7241 patients in 32 countries to assess the effects of budesonide in patients who had had mild persistent asthma for less than 2 years and who had not had previous regular treatment with glucocorticosteroids. Patients aged 5-66 years received either budesonide or placebo once daily for 3 years in addition to their usual asthma medications. The daily budesonide dose was 400 microg, or 200 microg for children younger than 11 years. The primary outcome was time to first severe asthma-related event, and analysis was by intention to treat.
FINDINGS: 198 of 3568 patients on placebo and 117 of 3597 on budesonide had at least one severe asthma exacerbation; hazard ratio 0.56 (95\% CI 0.45-0.71, p{\textless}0.0001). Patients on budesonide had fewer courses of systemic corticosteroids and more symptom-free days than did those on placebo. Compared with placebo, budesonide increased postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) from baseline by 1.48\% (p{\textless}0.0001) after 1 year and by 0.88\% (p=0.0005) after 3 years (expressed as percent of the predicted value). The corresponding increase in prebronchodilator FEV1 was 2.24\% after 1 year and 1.71\% after 3 years (p{\textless}0.0001 at both timepoints). The effect of treatment on all outcome variables was independent of the baseline lung function (prebronchodilator or postbronchodilator) or baseline medication. In children younger than 11 years, 3-year growth was reduced in the budesonide group by 1.34 cm. The reduction was greatest in the first year of treatment (0.58 cm) than years 2 and 3 (0.43 cm and 0.33 cm, respectively).
INTERPRETATION: Long-term, once-daily treatment with low-dose budesonide decreases the risk of severe exacerbations and improves asthma control in patients with mild persistent asthma of recent onset.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although guidelines recommend daily therapy for patients with mild persistent asthma, prescription patterns suggest that most such patients use these so-called controller therapies intermittently. In patients with mild persistent asthma, we evaluated the efficacy of intermittent short-course corticosteroid treatment guided by a symptom-based action plan alone or in addition to daily treatment with either inhaled budesonide or oral zafirlukast over a one-year period.
METHODS: In a double-blind trial, 225 adults underwent randomization. The primary outcome was morning peak expiratory flow (PEF). Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) before and after bronchodilator treatment, the frequency of exacerbations, the degree of asthma control, the number of symptom-free days, and the quality of life.
RESULTS: The three treatments produced similar increases in morning PEF (7.1 to 8.3 percent; approximately 32 liters per minute; P=0.90) and similar rates of asthma exacerbations (P=0.24), even though the intermittent-treatment group took budesonide, on average, for only 0.5 week of the year. As compared with intermittent therapy or daily zafirlukast therapy, daily budesonide therapy produced greater improvements in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (P=0.005), bronchial reactivity (P{\textless}0.001), the percentage of eosinophils in sputum (P=0.007), exhaled nitric oxide levels (P=0.006), scores for asthma control (P{\textless}0.001), and the number of symptom-free days (P=0.03), but not in post-bronchodilator FEV1 (P=0.29) or in the quality of life (P=0.18). Daily zafirlukast therapy did not differ significantly from intermittent treatment in any outcome measured.
CONCLUSIONS: It may be possible to treat mild persistent asthma with short, intermittent courses of inhaled or oral corticosteroids taken when symptoms worsen. Further studies are required to determine whether this novel approach to treatment should be recommended.},

We assessed the effects of adding a long-acting inhaled beta-agonist, formoterol, to low doses of an inhaled corticosteroid, budesonide, for 1 yr in subjects with mild asthma, receiving no or only a small dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The 698 corticosteroid free patients (Group A) were assigned to twice daily treatment with 100 microg budesonide, 100 microg budesonide plus 4.5 microg formoterol, or placebo. The 1,272 corticosteroid-treated patients (Group B) were assigned to twice daily treatment with 100 microg budesonide, 100 microg budesonide plus 4.5 microg formoterol, 200 microg budesonide, or 200 microg budesonide plus 4.5 microg formoterol. The main outcome variables were time to the first severe asthma exacerbation and poorly controlled asthma days. In Group A, budesonide alone reduced the risk for severe exacerbations by 60\% and poorly controlled days by 48\%; adding formoterol increased lung function with no change in other end points. By contrast, in Group B, adding formoterol reduced the risk for the first severe exacerbation and for poorly controlled days by 43 and 30\%, respectively. Thus, in corticosteroid-free patients, low dose inhaled budesonide alone reduced severe exacerbations and improved asthma control, and in patients already receiving inhaled corticosteroid, adding formoterol was more effective than doubling the corticosteroid dose.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence and prognosis of wheezing illness from birth to age 33 and the relation of incidence to perinatal, medical, social, environmental, and lifestyle factors.
DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal study.
SETTING: England, Scotland and Wales.
SUBJECTS: 18,559 people born on 3-9 March 1958. 5801 (31\%) contributed information at ages 7, 11, 16, 23, and 33 years. Attrition bias was evaluated using information on 14, 571 (79\%) subjects.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: History of asthma, wheezy bronchitis, or wheezing obtained from interview with subjects' parents at ages 7, 11, and 16 and reported at interview by subjects at ages 23 and 33.
RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of wheezing illness was 18\% by age 7, 24\% by age 16, and 43\% by age 33. Incidence during childhood was strongly and independently associated with pneumonia, hay fever, and eczema. There were weaker independent associations with male sex, third trimester antepartum haemorrhage, whooping cough, recurrent abdominal pain, and migraine. Incidence from age 17 to 33 was associated strongly with active cigarette smoking and a history of hay fever. There were weaker independent associations with female sex, maternal albuminuria during pregnancy, and histories of eczema and migraine. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was weakly and inconsistently related to childhood wheezing but was a stronger and significant independent predictor of incidence after age 16. Among 880 subjects who developed asthma or wheezy bronchitis from birth to age 7, 50\% had attacks in the previous year at age 7; 18\% at 11, 10\% at 16, 10\% at 23, and 27\% at 33. Relapse at 33 after prolonged remission of childhood wheezing was more common among current smokers and atopic subjects.
CONCLUSION: Atopy and active cigarette smoking are major influences on the incidence and recurrence of wheezing during adulthood.},

	abstract = {Glucocorticosteroids are a group of structurally related molecules that includes natural hormones and synthetic drugs with a wide range of anti-inflammatory potencies. For synthetic corticosteroid analogues it is commonly assumed that the therapeutic index cannot be improved by increasing their glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity. The validity of this assumption, particularly for inhaled corticosteroids, has not been fully explored. Inhaled corticosteroids exert their anti-inflammatory activity locally in the airways, and hence this can be dissociated from their potential to cause systemic adverse effects. The molecular structural features that increase glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity and selectivity drive topical anti-inflammatory activity. However, in addition, these structural modifications also result in physicochemical and pharmacokinetic changes that can enhance targeting to the airways and reduce systemic exposure. As a consequence, potency and therapeutic index can be correlated. However, this consideration is not reflected in asthma treatment guidelines that classify inhaled corticosteroid formulations as low-, mid- and high dose, and imbed a simple dose equivalence approach where potency is not considered to affect the therapeutic index. This article describes the relationship between potency and therapeutic index, and concludes that higher potency can potentially improve the therapeutic index. Therefore, both efficacy and safety should be considered when classifying inhaled corticosteroid regimens in terms of dose equivalence. The historical approach to dose equivalence in asthma treatment guidelines is not appropriate for the wider range of molecules, potencies and device/formulations now available. A more robust method is needed that incorporates pharmacological principles.},

	abstract = {Background
The importance of balance between controller and reliever medications in asthma is recognized. However, to our knowledge, the extent to which real-world practice has caught up with evidence-based guidelines has not been studied.
Methods
This was a retrospective cohort study of individuals 15 to 67 years of age who satisfied a validated case definition of asthma in the administrative health database of British Columbia, Canada between 2002 and 2013. Each patient-year was assessed for inappropriate and excessive prescription of short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) and the balance between controller and reliever medications. Trends on three time axes were evaluated: calendar time, time course of asthma, and age. Poisson regression was used to test for a linear trend.
Results
Three hundred fifty-six thousand, one hundred twelve patients (56.5\% female sex; mean age, 30.5 years) contributed 2.6 million patient-years. In 7.3\% of the patient-years, SABAs were prescribed inappropriately. This proportion dropped by a relative rate of 5.3\% per year (P {\textless} .001). In the first year of asthma, 6.3\% of patients had indicators of inappropriate SABA use, which dropped within the first 3 years but increased thereafter. Excessive prescription of SABAs increased rapidly during the time course of asthma (change of 23.3\% per year; P {\textless} .001) and by age (change of 5.1\% per year; P {\textless} .001).
Conclusions
Despite overwhelming evidence regarding the risks, inappropriate prescription for SABAs was prevalent. Excessive SABA use might explain high asthma mortality in older patients. Inappropriate prescriptions declined over the study period but increased over the time course of asthma. These trends might have contributed to the declining asthma hospitalization rates in British Columbia, but there remain gaps in care and potential for improvement in asthma outcomes.},

It is a global health issue, with cigarette smoking being an important risk factor universally; other factors, such as exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution, occupational hazards, and infections, are also important. As the global population ages, the burden of COPD will increase in years to come. Prevalence estimates of the disorder show considerable variability across populations, suggesting that risk factors can affect populations differently. Other advances in our understanding of COPD are increased recognition of the importance of comorbid disease, identification of different COPD phenotypes, and understanding how factors other than lung function affect outcome in our patients. The challenge we will all face in the next few years will be implementation of cost-effective prevention and management strategies to stem the tide of this disease and its cost.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The propensity score is defined as a subject's probability of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates. Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects. However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment. We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups. We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample. The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher-order moments, and interactions. The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample. Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study. We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of ‘best practice’ when using IPTW to estimate causal treatment effects using observational data. © 2015 The Authors.

The “true” imputation model may contain nonlinearities which are not included in default imputation models. Random forest imputation is a machine learning technique which can accommodate nonlinearities and interactions and does not require a particular regression model to be specified. We compared parametric MICE with a random forest-based MICE algorithm in 2 simulation studies. The first study used 1,000 random samples of 2,000 persons drawn from the 10,128 stable angina patients in the CALIBER database (Cardiovascular Disease Research using Linked Bespoke Studies and Electronic Records; 2001–2010) with complete data on all covariates. Variables were artificially made “missing at random,” and the bias and efficiency of parameter estimates obtained using different imputation methods were compared. Both MICE methods produced unbiased estimates of (log) hazard ratios, but random forest was more efficient and produced narrower confidence intervals. The second study used simulated data in which the partially observed variable depended on the fully observed variables in a nonlinear way. Parameter estimates were less biased using random forest MICE, and confidence interval coverage was better. This suggests that random forest imputation may be useful for imputing complex epidemiologic data sets in which some patients have missing data.},

	abstract = {Variable selection is fundamental to high-dimensional statistical modeling, including nonparametric regression. Many approaches in use are stepwise selection procedures, which can be computationally expensive and ignore stochastic errors in the variable selection process. In this article, penalized likelihood approaches are proposed to handle these kinds of problems. The proposed methods select variables and estimate coefficients simultaneously. Hence they enable us to construct confidence intervals for estimated parameters. The proposed approaches are distinguished from others in that the penalty functions are symmetric, nonconcave on (0, ∞), and have singularities at the origin to produce sparse solutions. Furthermore, the penalty functions should be bounded by a constant to reduce bias and satisfy certain conditions to yield continuous solutions. A new algorithm is proposed for optimizing penalized likelihood functions. The proposed ideas are widely applicable. They are readily applied to a variety of parametric models such as generalized linear models and robust regression models. They can also be applied easily to nonparametric modeling by using wavelets and splines. Rates of convergence of the proposed penalized likelihood estimators are established. Furthermore, with proper choice of regularization parameters, we show that the proposed estimators perform as well as the oracle procedure in variable selection; namely, they work as well as if the correct submodel were known. Our simulation shows that the newly proposed methods compare favorably with other variable selection techniques. Furthermore, the standard error formulas are tested to be accurate enough for practical applications.},

To overcome the difficulty of unknown covariance matrix of random effects, we propose to use a proxy matrix in the penalized profile likelihood. We establish conditions on the choice of the proxy matrix and show that the proposed procedure enjoys the model selection consistency where the number of fixed effects is allowed to grow exponentially with the sample size. We further propose a group variable selection strategy to simultaneously select and estimate important random effects, where the unknown covariance matrix of random effects is replaced with a proxy matrix. We prove that, with the proxy matrix appropriately chosen, the proposed procedure can identify all true random effects with asymptotic probability one, where the dimension of random effects vector is allowed to increase exponentially with the sample size. Monte Carlo simulation studies are conducted to examine the finite-sample performance of the proposed procedures. We further illustrate the proposed procedures via a real data example.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: The effect of early life wheezing on respiratory function and continued symptoms through adolescence has not been fully described. Using data from a population-based birth cohort in Tucson, Arizona, we previously described four phenotypes based on the occurrence of wheezing lower respiratory illnesses before age 3 yr and active wheeze at age 6 yr: never wheezers (n = 425), transient early wheezers (n = 164), persistent wheezers (n = 113), and late-onset wheezers (n = 124).
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the prognosis for these phenotypes, with reference to lung function and symptoms, through adolescence.
METHODS: Current wheeze was assessed by questionnaire, lung function was measured by conventional spirometry, and atopy was determined by skin prick tests.
RESULTS: The prevalence of atopy and wheeze by age 16 yr was similar for never and transient wheezers and for persistent and late-onset wheezers. Both transient early, and persistent wheezers had significantly lower FEF(25-75) (-259 ml/s, p {\textless} 0.001, and -260 ml/s, p = 0.001, respectively), FEV1 (-75 ml, p = 0.02, and -87 ml, p = 0.03, respectively), and FEV1:FVC ratio (-1.9\%, p = 0.002, and -2.5\%, p = 0.001, respectively) through age 16 yr compared with never wheezers. Late-onset wheezers had levels of lung function similar to those of never wheezers through age 16 yr. There was no significant change in lung function among subjects with any of the four phenotypes, relative to their peers, from age 6 to 16 yr.
CONCLUSION: Patterns of wheezing prevalence and levels of lung function are established by age 6 yr and do not appear to change significantly by age 16 yr in children who start having asthma-like symptoms during the preschool years.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The outcome of childhood asthma in adults has been described in high-risk cohorts, but few population-based studies have reported the risk factors for persistence and relapse.
METHODS: We assessed children born from April 1972 through March 1973 in Dunedin, New Zealand, repeatedly from 9 to 26 years of age with questionnaires, pulmonary-function tests, bronchial-challenge testing, and allergy testing.
RESULTS: By the age of 26 years, 51.4 percent of 613 study members with complete respiratory data had reported wheezing at more than one assessment. Eighty-nine study members (14.5 percent) had wheezing that persisted from childhood to 26 years of age, whereas 168 (27.4 percent) had remission, but 76 (12.4 percent) subsequently relapsed by the age of 26. Sensitization to house dust mites predicted the persistence of wheezing (odds ratio, 2.41; P=0.001) and relapse (odds ratio, 2.18; P=0.01), as did airway hyperresponsiveness (odds ratio for persistence, 3.00; P{\textless}0.001; odds ratio for relapse, 3.03; P{\textless}0.001). Female sex predicted the persistence of wheezing (odds ratio, 1.71; P=0.03), as did smoking at the age of 21 years (odds ratio, 1.84; P=0.01). The earlier the age at onset, the greater the risk of relapse (odds ratio, 0.89 per year of increase in the age at onset; P{\textless}0.001). Pulmonary function was consistently lower in those with persistent wheezing than in those without persistent wheezing.
CONCLUSIONS: In an unselected birth cohort, more than one in four children had wheezing that persisted from childhood to adulthood or that relapsed after remission. The factors predicting persistence or relapse were sensitization to house dust mites, airway hyperresponsiveness, female sex, smoking, and early age at onset. These findings, together with persistently low lung function, suggest that outcomes in adult asthma may be determined primarily in early childhood.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pharmacoepidemiological research using administrative databases has become increasingly popular for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS); however, without a validated case definition the cohort evaluated may be inaccurate resulting in biased and incorrect outcomes. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a generalizable administrative database case definition for CRS using International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition (ICD-9)-coded claims.
METHODS: A random sample of 100 patients with a guideline-based diagnosis of CRS and 100 control patients were selected and then linked to a Canadian physician claims database from March 31, 2010, to March 31, 2015. The proportion of CRS ICD-9-coded claims (473.x and 471.x) for each of these 200 patients were reviewed and the validity of 7 different ICD-9-based coding algorithms was evaluated.
RESULTS: The CRS case definition of ≥2 claims with a CRS ICD-9 code (471.x or 473.x) within 2 years of the reference case provides a balanced validity with a sensitivity of 77\% and specificity of 79\%. Applying this CRS case definition to the claims database produced a CRS cohort of 51,000 patients with characteristics that were consistent with published demographics and rates of comorbid asthma, allergic rhinitis, and depression.
CONCLUSION: This study has validated several coding algorithms; based on the results a case definition of ≥2 physician claims of CRS (ICD-9 of 471.x or 473.x) within 2 years provides an optimal level of validity. Future studies will need to validate this administrative case definition from different health system perspectives and using larger retrospective chart reviews from multiple providers.},

	abstract = {In 1995, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines recommended goals for the management of asthma, which were updated in 2002. However, there are no recent international surveys on the real management of asthma. The Asthma Insights and Reality surveys are the first large-scale surveys aimed at determining international variations in the severity, control, and management of asthma in children and adults. A cross-section of households in 29 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia were surveyed to identify from the general population asthmatic patients with symptoms within the last year or who were taking current asthma medication. A standard questionnaire was administered to 7786 adults, and, through a proxy, to 3153 children with asthma. Objective and subjective patient perception of asthma control and severity were assessed, including access to medical care, health care use, missed work-school, and medication use. Despite variations at a country level, a substantial effect of asthma on patients' lives was observed, with considerable loss of schooldays and workdays. The current level of asthma control worldwide falls far short of the goals for long-term management in international guidelines. A significant proportion of patients continue to have symptoms and lifestyle restrictions and to require emergency care. The proportion of adult asthmatic patients who were current smokers was also high. However, the use of anti-inflammatory preventative medication, even in patients with severe persistent asthma, was low, ranging from 26\% in Western Europe to 9\% in Japan, as was the use of objective lung function testing. The correlation between self-perceived severity of asthma and objective assessment of severity on the basis of GINA criteria was consistently poor in all areas. We conclude that there is direct evidence for suboptimal asthma control in many patients worldwide, despite the availability of effective therapies, with long-term management falling far short of the goals set in the GINA guidelines.},

	abstract = {Background: For many years, the association between asthma and rhinitis has primarily been attributed to a common allergic background. Recently, it has been suggested that asthma and rhinitis are associated in the absence of atopy. The nature of this association is not well known. Objective: The purpose of this study, which was performed in a large, longitudinal community population, was to determine the extent to which rhinitis is an independent risk factor for adult-onset asthma. Methods: We carried out a nested case-control study from the longitudinal cohort of the Tucson Epidemiologic Study of Obstructive Lung Diseases. One hundred seventy-three incident patients with physician-confirmed asthma were compared with 2177 subjects who reported no asthma or shortness of breath with wheezing. Potential risk factors, including the presence of rhinitis, were assessed before the onset of asthma (patients) or before the last completed survey (control subjects). Results: Rhinitis was a significant risk factor for asthma (crude odds ratio, 4.13; 95\% confidence interval, 2.88-5.92). After adjustment for years of follow-up, age, sex, atopic status, smoking status, and presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the magnitude of the association was reduced but still highly significant (adjusted odds ratio, 3.21; 95\% confidence interval, 2.19-4.71). After stratification, rhinitis increased the risk of development of asthma by about 3 times both among atopic and nonatopic patients and by more than 5 times among patients in the highest IgE tertile. Patients with rhinitis with persistent and severe nasal symptoms and a personal history of physician-confirmed sinusitis had an additional increased risk of asthma development. Conclusion: We conclude that rhinitis is a significant risk factor for adult-onset asthma in both atopic and nonatopic subjects. The nature of the association between rhinitis and asthma is open to interpretation. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2002;109:419-25.)},

This review, arising from the work of an American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society Task Force, identifies the need for separate concepts of control and severity, describes their evolution in asthma guidelines and provides a framework for understanding the relationship between current concepts of asthma phenotype, severity and control. "Asthma control" refers to the extent to which the manifestations of asthma have been reduced or removed by treatment. Its assessment should incorporate the dual components of current clinical control (e.g. symptoms, reliever use and lung function) and future risk (e.g. exacerbations and lung function decline). The most clinically useful concept of asthma severity is based on the intensity of treatment required to achieve good asthma control, i.e. severity is assessed during treatment. Severe asthma is defined as the requirement for (not necessarily just prescription or use of) high-intensity treatment. Asthma severity may be influenced by the underlying disease activity and by the patient's phenotype, both of which may be further described using pathological and physiological markers. These markers can also act as surrogate measures for future risk.},

Multiple causes no doubt exist for both its inception and symptom exacerbation once the disease is established. Factors underlying inception can range from viral respiratory tract infections in infancy to occupational exposures in adults. Factors underlying asthma exacerbations include allergen exposure in sensitized individuals, viral infections, exercise, irritants, and ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents among others. Exacerbating factors might include one or all of these exposures and vary both among and within patients. Asthma treatment is determined to a large extent after an assessment of severity, which can be variable over time and assessed in 2 domains: impairment (current) and risk (long-term consequences). Unfortunately, despite the availability of effective therapies, suboptimal asthma control exists in many patients on a worldwide basis.

	abstract = {Approaches to the management of moderate-to-severe persistent asthma in both children and adults are widely accepted but the treatment of mild persistent asthma remains controversial because of the lack of agreement on what constitutes mild asthma and whether regular treatment is required at all. Recent evidence indicates that 'mild asthma' may not be as benign a condition as was widely believed and should be treated to improve asthma control and to prevent the significant burden of exacerbation and progression of disease. This is supported by compelling evidence from histologic and clinical studies that have attributed irreversible pathologic and functional airway changes to consequences of persistent airway inflammation and under-treated asthma. This article focuses on the rationale of early treatment of mild persistent asthma, and discusses the various findings from the largest randomized, early-intervention trial with inhaled corticosteroids as regular treatment in patients with asthma of recent onset--the START (inhaled Steroid Treatment As Regular Therapy in early asthma) study. A brief review of the background of the natural history of asthma, the findings from key longitudinal epidemiologic studies on disease progression in children and adults, and the effect of inhaled corticosteroids on this progression are included, to provide further insight into the impact of early treatment on asthma management guidelines.},

	abstract = {Environmental exposures during the early years and airway obstruction that develops during this time, in conjunction with genetic susceptibility, are important factors in the development of persistent asthma in childhood. Established risk factors for childhood asthma include frequent wheezing during the first 3 years, a parental history of asthma, a history of eczema, allergic rhinitis, wheezing apart from colds, and peripheral blood eosinophilia, as well as allergic sensitization to aeroallergens and certain foods. Risk factors for the development of asthma in adulthood remain ill defined. Moreover, reasons for variability in the clinical course of asthma--persistence in some individuals and progression in others--remain an enigma. The distinction between disease persistence and disease progression suggests that these are different entities or phenotypes. There is currently no consensus on whether disease progression requires either airway inflammation or airway remodeling or the combination of the two. For patients with irreversible airway obstruction, inflammation might, in part, be necessary but perhaps not entirely sufficient to induce the irreversible component, some of which could be attributed to alterations in the structure of the bronchial wall. Intervening with intermittent or daily inhaled corticosteroids in high-risk infants and children does not prevent disease progression or impaired lung growth. These findings, however, might not apply to adults, and further study in adults is needed to determine the effect of inhaled corticosteroid therapy on disease progression.},

	abstract = {This review is the synthesis of a working group on mild asthma. Mild asthma includes intermittent and persistent mild asthma according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) classification, and affects between 50\% and 75\% of asthmatic patients. Mild asthma is more frequent, more symptomatic, and less well controlled in children than in adults. Cohort studies from childhood to adulthood show that asthma severity usually remains stable over time. Nevertheless, mild asthma can lead to severe exacerbations, with a frequency ranging from 0.12 to 0.77 per patient-year. Severe exacerbations in mild asthma represent 30-40\% of asthma exacerbations requiring emergency consultation. In mild asthma, inflammation and structural remodelling are constant, of varying intensity, but nonspecific. Therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) decreases bronchial inflammation, but has only a slight effect on structural remodelling, and, when stopped, inflammation immediately recurs. Permanent low-dose ICS therapy is the reference treatment for persistent mild asthma. Effectiveness is to be reassessed at 3 months, and if it is insufficient the patient is no longer considered mildly asthmatic, and treatment has to be stepped up. As mild asthma is the most frequent form of the disease, diagnosis and management require physicians' particular attention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systemic corticosteroids are a leading cause of drug-related complications, yet little has been done to quantify the dose-response relationship between systemic corticosteroid exposure and complications in patients with severe asthma.
OBJECTIVES: To (a) evaluate the risk of developing systemic corticosteroid-related complications by corticosteroid exposure in severe asthma and (b) quantify the associated health care resource utilization and costs.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study using administrative claims data from a large commercial database between 2003 and 2014. Multivariate generalized estimating equation models were used to compare corticosteroid-related complications in patients continuously exposed to at least 5 mg of prednisone or equivalent for ≥ 6 months with a 1:1 ratio of propensity score-matched patients with asthma who did not use corticosteroids.
RESULTS: A total of 12,697 corticosteroid users and as many matched nonusers were identified. The odds of developing associated complications increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner with systemic corticosteroid exposure: odds ratios were 2.50, 2.95, and 3.32 (P values {\textless}0.05) for low (defined as {\textless} 5 mg/day), medium (≥ 5-10 mg/day), and high ({\textgreater}10 mg/day) exposure, respectively, relative to no exposure. Health care resource utilization increased significantly with levels of systemic corticosteroid exposure. Hence, incidence rate ratios for inpatient visits with low, medium, and high exposure relative to none were estimated to be 1.86, 2.40, and 3.37, respectively (P {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: A significant dose-response relationship was found between the long-term use of systemic corticosteroids and the risk of developing systemic corticosteroid-related complications in patients with severe asthma, resulting in increased burden and costs on the health care system that intensified with systemic corticosteroid exposure.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study.
SETTING: The primary care Optimum Patient Care Research Database and the British Thoracic Society Difficult Asthma Registry.
PARTICIPANTS: Optimum Patient Care Research Database (7195 subjects in three age- and gender-matched groups)-severe asthma (Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) treatment step 5 with four or more prescriptions/year of oral corticosteroids, n=808), mild/moderate asthma (GINA treatment step 2/3, n=3975) and non-asthma controls (n=2412). 770 subjects with severe asthma from the British Thoracic Society Difficult Asthma Registry (442 receiving daily oral corticosteroids to maintain disease control).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence rates of morbidities associated with systemic steroid exposure were evaluated and reported separately for each group.
RESULTS: 748/808 (93\%) subjects with severe asthma had one or more condition linked to systemic corticosteroid exposure (mild/moderate asthma 3109/3975 (78\%), non-asthma controls 1548/2412 (64\%); p{\textless}0.001 for severe asthma versus non-asthma controls). Compared with mild/moderate asthma, morbidity rates for severe asthma were significantly higher for conditions associated with systemic steroid exposure (type II diabetes 10\% vs 7\%, OR=1.46 (95\% CI 1.11 to 1.91), p{\textless}0.01; osteoporosis 16\% vs 4\%, OR=5.23, (95\% CI 3.97 to 6.89), p{\textless}0.001; dyspeptic disorders (including gastric/duodenal ulceration) 65\% vs 34\%, OR=3.99, (95\% CI 3.37 to 4.72), p{\textless}0.001; cataracts 9\% vs 5\%, OR=1.89, (95\% CI 1.39 to 2.56), p{\textless}0.001). In the British Thoracic Society Difficult Asthma Registry similar prevalence rates were found, although, additionally, high rates of osteopenia (35\%) and obstructive sleep apnoea (11\%) were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral corticosteroid-related adverse events are common in severe asthma. New treatments which reduce exposure to oral corticosteroids may reduce the prevalence of these conditions and this should be considered in cost-effectiveness analyses of these new treatments.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many patients with severe asthma require maintenance treatment with systemic corticosteroids (SCSs) to control daily symptoms and prevent serious acute exacerbations, but chronic SCS use is associated with complications.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the risk of SCS-related complications by SCS exposure and quantify the associated health care costs and resource use in patients with severe asthma.
METHODS: We performed a longitudinal, open-cohort, observational study using health insurance claims data (1997-2013: Medicaid) from Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Mississippi, and New Jersey. Eligible patients were 12 years old or older with 2 or more asthma diagnoses and had more than 6 months of continuous SCS use. An open-cohort approach was used to classify patients' follow-up into low, medium, and high SCS exposure (≤ 6, {\textgreater}6-12, and {\textgreater}12 mg/d, respectively). Multivariate generalized estimating equation models were used to estimate the adjusted risk of SCS-related complications for patients with medium and high exposure compared with patients with low exposure and quantify the resulting health care resource use and costs.
RESULTS: The study included 3628 patients (mean age, 57.6 years; 68\% female). Patients with medium and high SCS exposure had significantly higher risks of SCS-related complications, including infections and cardiovascular, metabolic, psychiatric, ocular, gastrointestinal, and bone-related complications (odds ratio, 1.23-2.12 by complication; P {\textless} .05 for all but one) versus those with low (reference group) SCS exposure. Medium and high SCS exposure were also associated with significantly more emergency department visits (incidence rate ratios, 1.31 [P = .0004] and 1.78 [P {\textless} .0001]) and inpatient visits (incidence rate ratios, 1.25 [P {\textless} .0001] and 1.59 [P {\textless} .0001]) versus low SCS exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant dose-response relationship was demonstrated between chronic SCS use and risk of SCS-related complications in patients with severe asthma. Effective SCS-sparing strategies might reduce the burden associated with SCS-related complications in patients with severe asthma.},

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the characteristics, clinical, and economic burden of SUA in a managed-care setting.
METHODS: This observational study identified patients with persistent asthma aged 12 years or more (N = 25,935) using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision asthma codes and Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set administrative criteria. An SUA subgroup was identified when all of the following 3 criteria were met in 2012: (1) 2 or more asthma exacerbations; (2) 6 or more medium- or high-dose dispensed canisters of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) as monotherapy or with long-acting β2-agonist; and (3) 3 or more dispensed non-ICS controllers. Health care utilization and direct costs (all-cause and asthma-related) in 2013 were compared between SUA and non-SUA subgroups using multivariable regression.
RESULTS: Compared with the non-SUA subgroup (N = 25,350, 97.7\%), the SUA subgroup (N = 585, 2.3\%) at baseline was significantly older and had more comorbidities, asthma specialist care, controller medication dispensed, and asthma exacerbations. During follow-up, patients with SUA exhibited significantly more asthma exacerbations and short-acting β2-agonist use, and higher all-cause and asthma-related costs than patients with non-SUA. The adjusted asthma-related average direct cost per patient at follow-up was significantly higher for SUA (mean ± SE) (\$2325 ± \$75) than non-SUA (\$1261 ± \$9) with an incremental cost of \$1056 (95\% CI, \$907-\$1205). Asthma drugs accounted for the major difference (incremental cost of \$848/patient; 95\% CI, \$737-\$959).
CONCLUSION: Increases and disparities in health care utilization and direct cost by SUA status suggest that patients with SUA require more intensive therapy, greater attention to adherence and comorbidities, more specialist care, and, possibly, personalized treatment approaches including novel biologic treatments.},

OBJECTIVE: To describe patient characteristics and disease burden associated with C-OCS use by adults with persistent asthma.
METHODS: We identified 9546 patients aged 18 to 64 years in a large managed care organization who met the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set 2-year criteria (2009-2010) for persistent asthma. A subgroup had blood eosinophil counts. We calculated cumulative OCS dispensed per patient in 2010 and examined the distribution of disease characteristics by average daily amounts of OCS dispensed. C-OCS use was defined as 2.5 mg/d or more. Baseline factors (2010) associated with C-OCS use during follow-up (2011) were investigated by multivariable Poisson regression.
RESULTS: At baseline, 782 (8.2\%) patients were C-OCS users. Compared with patients who received no or less than 2.5 mg/d OCS, C-OCS users were older and more often female and ethnic minorities; and had more comorbidities, asthma specialist care, greater step-care level, controllers, asthma exacerbations, and greater blood eosinophil counts (all P {\textless} .01). Baseline factors significantly associated with C-OCS use in the follow-up year included (1) demographic characteristics: older age, females, blacks versus whites, and whites versus others/unknown ethnicities; (2) disease burden: more asthma emergency department or hospitalization visits, greater step-care level, excessive short-acting β2-agonist dispensed, theophylline use, asthma specialist care, and nasal polyposis; (3) greater blood eosinophil counts; and (4) most strongly, C-OCS use.
CONCLUSIONS: C-OCS use was associated with more asthma burden, comorbidities, and greater blood eosinophil counts. Prior C-OCS use was the strongest predictor of future C-OCS use.},

Yet limited data are available about the risks following chronic use in patients with severe asthma, who are at risk of long-term SGC-related complications. This study was carried out to investigate the risks of developing SGC-related complications, and to quantify the associated healthcare resource utilization and costs for patients with severe asthma in the United States.
METHODS: This was a longitudinal, open-cohort, observational study. Medicaid claims data (1997-2013) for patients ≥12 years old with ≥2 asthma diagnoses were used. A total of 26,987 SGC non-users were identified for inclusion in the study, alongside 3628 SGC users with ≥6 months' continuous SGC use.
RESULTS: Multivariate generalized estimating equation models were used to estimate the adjusted risk of developing SGC-related complications, and to quantify the associated healthcare resource utilization and costs. This analysis compared SGC users with SGC non-users, and found that SGC users had an increased likelihood of developing complications. A significant dose-response relationship was demonstrated between chronic SGC use and risk of developing any complications (odds ratios for low, medium, and high SGC exposure were 2.03 [p = .0511], 2.85 [p {\textless} .0001], and 3.64 [p {\textless} .0001], respectively, vs. SGC non-users). The increased likelihood of SGC-related complications translated into estimated annual healthcare costs for SGC users of \$2712 to \$8560 above those of SGC non-users. A key limitation of this study is the disparity in age between the SGC users and the SGC non-users; however, age was included as a confounding factor in the analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the risk associated with chronic use of SGCs, irrespective of dose level, and highlight the need for new SGC-sparing treatment strategies for patients with severe asthma.},

The burden of chronic respiratory diseases is generally increasing across the globe, and asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are among the main causes of mortality and morbidity. However, the direct and indirect costs of these conditions vary across jurisdictions. This article reports on recent estimates of the costs of asthma and COPD, with a focus on comparing disease burden across different regions. Overall, there is tremendous variation in per capita annual costs of asthma and COPD. However, the methodology of the cost-of-illness studies is also vastly different, making it difficult to associate differences in reported costs to differences in the true burden of asthma and COPD. Suggestions are provided towards improving the validity and comparability of future studies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare different chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cost-effectiveness models with respect to structure and input parameters and to cross-validate the models by running the same hypothetical treatment scenarios.
METHODS: COPD modeling groups simulated four hypothetical interventions with their model and compared the results with a reference scenario of no intervention. The four interventions modeled assumed 1) 20\% reduction in decline in lung function, 2) 25\% reduction in exacerbation frequency, 3) 10\% reduction in all-cause mortality, and 4) all these effects combined. The interventions were simulated for a 5-year and lifetime horizon with standardization, if possible, for sex, age, COPD severity, smoking status, exacerbation frequencies, mortality due to other causes, utilities, costs, and discount rates. Furthermore, uncertainty around the outcomes of intervention four was compared.
RESULTS: Seven out of nine contacted COPD modeling groups agreed to participate. The 5-year incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the most comprehensive intervention, intervention four, was €17,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for two models, €25,000 to €28,000/QALY for three models, and €47,000/QALY for the remaining two models. Differences in the ICERs could mainly be explained by differences in input values for disease progression, exacerbation-related mortality, and all-cause mortality, with high input values resulting in low ICERs and vice versa. Lifetime results were mainly affected by the input values for mortality. The probability of intervention four to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay value of €50,000/QALY was 90\% to 100\% for five models and about 70\% and 50\% for the other two models, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was the most important factor determining the differences in cost-effectiveness outcomes between models.},

Health state utility value (HSUV) is a recognized measure for health economic appraisals and is extensively used as an indicator for decision-making studies. This study is a systematic review of literature aimed to estimate mean utility value in COPD using meta-analysis and explore degree of heterogeneity in the utility values across a variety of clinical and study characteristic. The literature review covers studies that used EQ-5D to estimate utility value for patient level research in COPD. Studies that reported utility values elicited by EQ-5D in COPD patients were selected for random-effect meta-analysis addressing inter-study heterogeneity and subgroup analyses. Thirty-two studies were included in the general utility meta-analysis. The estimated general utility value was 0.673 (95\% CI 0.653 to 0.693). Meta-analyses of COPD stages utility values showed influence of airway obstruction on utility value. The utility values ranged from 0.820 (95\% CI 0.767 to 0.872) for stage I to 0.624 (95\% CI 0.571 to 0.677) for stage IV. There was substantial heterogeneity in utility values: I(2) = 97.7\%. A more accurate measurement of utility values in COPD is needed to refine valid and generalizable scores of HSUV. Given the limited success of the factors studied to reduce heterogeneity, an approach needs to be developed how best to use mean utility values for COPD in health economic evaluation.},

This study used a preference-based quality of life measure questionnaire (EQ-5D) to evaluate the impact of exacerbation on health status and utility during a patient's admission to hospital and short-term follow-up. Costs of admission were calculated. In total, 149 patients consented to take part in the study representing 222 admissions to hospital. At admission patients reported high levels of problems for all dimensions of the EQ-5D. Mean utility (-0.077) and Visual Analogue Scale (25.9) values indicated great impairment, with 61\% of patients having a negative utility value representing a health state equivalent to 'worse than death' at admission. Many problems were still reported at discharge. By 3 months follow-up patients had deteriorated, with percentages of patients reporting problems in mobility (98\%) and usual activity (88\%) almost back up to admission levels. Health status and utility values were similar regardless of lung function at admission and at discharge. Approximately half of the patients in each category had a negative utility value at admission representing a health state 'worse than death', with similar levels of improvement by discharge. The mean cost of an admission was 2130.34 pounds (SD 1326.09) with only a mean of 110.37 pounds(5\%) because of medication. No differences were noted by lung function category. In conclusion, all COPD patients requiring admission for an exacerbation suffer a serious deterioration in health status which, although improves during admission, notably deteriorates by 3 months postdischarge.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-acting beta-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids are used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but their effect on survival is unknown.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial comparing salmeterol at a dose of 50 microg plus fluticasone propionate at a dose of 500 microg twice daily (combination regimen), administered with a single inhaler, with placebo, salmeterol alone, or fluticasone propionate alone for a period of 3 years. The primary outcome was death from any cause for the comparison between the combination regimen and placebo; the frequency of exacerbations, health status, and spirometric values were also assessed.
RESULTS: Of 6112 patients in the efficacy population, 875 died within 3 years after the start of the study treatment. All-cause mortality rates were 12.6\% in the combination-therapy group, 15.2\% in the placebo group, 13.5\% in the salmeterol group, and 16.0\% in the fluticasone group. The hazard ratio for death in the combination-therapy group, as compared with the placebo group, was 0.825 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.681 to 1.002; P=0.052, adjusted for the interim analyses), corresponding to a difference of 2.6 percentage points or a reduction in the risk of death of 17.5\%. The mortality rate for salmeterol alone or fluticasone propionate alone did not differ significantly from that for placebo. As compared with placebo, the combination regimen reduced the annual rate of exacerbations from 1.13 to 0.85 and improved health status and spirometric values (P{\textless}0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). There was no difference in the incidence of ocular or bone side effects. The probability of having pneumonia reported as an adverse event was higher among patients receiving medications containing fluticasone propionate (19.6\% in the combination-therapy group and 18.3\% in the fluticasone group) than in the placebo group (12.3\%, P{\textless}0.001 for comparisons between these treatments and placebo).
CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in death from all causes among patients with COPD in the combination-therapy group did not reach the predetermined level of statistical significance.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tiotropium HandiHaler (TioH) has been shown to improve lung function, exacerbations, and quality of life when added to the pharmacotherapy of patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The purpose of this meta-analysis was to synthesize current evidence regarding the impact of TioH on the survival rate of these patients, which is still controversial.
METHODS: A systematic search in the electronic databases of the Cochrane Library, Medline, Scopus, EMBASE, PschINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science was conducted by two independent authors (December 2012). Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing inhaled TioH versus control (placebo or open control) were included. Data on total mortality were extracted, and missing data were obtained from authors. Relative risk (RR) for total mortality was calculated for each study and pooled. Heterogeneity, the risk of bias, and the publication bias were assessed in accordance with Cochrane's guidance.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight RCTs, evaluating 33,538 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Data were nonheterogeneous, so fixed-effects model analysis was used. The effect of TioH versus placebo was assessed in 19 RCTs, with a total population of 19,826 patients (31,914 patient years), of whom 1,018 died during the study period. A statistically significant decrease in all-cause mortality was associated with the administration of TioH [RR 0.86, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.76-0.98]. The number needed to treat to prevent one fatality was estimated to be 64 (95\% CI 56-110). Comparisons of tiotropium against six more comparators were identified, but the insufficient sample size did not allow robust comparisons with respect to mortality.
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis of RCTs showed that TioH prolongs the survival of COPD patients compared with placebo. Further RCTs are needed to confirm the potential superiority of prescriptions with versus without TioH in mortality reduction.},

DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, the pharmaceutical company clinical trials register, the US Food and Drug Administration website, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomised controlled trials from inception to July 2010.
STUDY SELECTION: Trials were selected for inclusion if they were parallel group randomised controlled trials of tiotropium solution using a mist inhaler (Respimat Soft Mist Inhaler, Boehringer Ingelheim) versus placebo for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the treatment duration was more than 30 days, and they reported data on mortality. Relative risks of all cause mortality were estimated using a fixed effect meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed with the I(2) statistic.
RESULTS: Five randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion. Tiotropium mist inhaler was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality (90/3686 v 47/2836; relative risk 1.52, 95\% confidence interval, 1.06 to 2.16; P = 0.02; I(2) = 0\%). Both 10 µg (2.15, 1.03 to 4.51; P = 0.04; I(2) = 9\%) and 5 µg (1.46, 1.01 to 2.10; P = 0.04; I(2) = 0\%) doses of tiotropium mist inhaler were associated with an increased risk of mortality. The overall estimates were not substantially changed by sensitivity analysis of the fixed effect analysis of the five trials combined using the random effects model (1.45, 1.02 to 2.07; P = 0.04), limiting the analysis to three trials of one year's duration each (1.50, 1.05 to 2.15), or the inclusion of additional data on tiotropium mist inhaler from another investigational drug programme (1.42, 1.01 to 2.00). The number needed to treat for a year with the 5 µg dose to see one additional death was estimated to be 124 (95\% confidence interval 52 to 5682) based on the average control event rate from the long term trials.

	abstract = {Objectives To understand the concerns and challenges faced by general practitioners (GPs) and respiratory physicians about primary care management of acute exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Design 21 focus group discussions (FGDs) were performed in seven countries with a Grounded Theory approach. Each country performed three rounds of FGDs.
Setting Primary and secondary care in Norway, Germany, Wales, Poland, Russia, The Netherlands, China (Hong Kong).
Participants 142 GPs and respiratory physicians were chosen to include urban and rural GPs as well as hospital-based and out patient-clinic respiratory physicians.
Results Management of acute COPD exacerbations is dealt with within a scope of concerns. These concerns range from ‘dealing with comorbidity’ through ‘having difficult patients’ to ‘confronting a hopeless disease’. The first concern displays medical uncertainty regarding diagnosis, medication and hospitalisation. These clinical processes become blurred by comorbidity and the social context of the patient. The second concern shows how patients receive the label ‘difficult’ exactly because they need complex attention, but even more because they are time consuming, do not take responsibility and are non-compliant. The third concern relates to the emotional reactions by the physicians when confronted with ‘a hopeless disease’ due to the fact that most of the patients do not improve and the treatment slows down the process at best. GPs and respiratory physicians balance these concerns with medical knowledge and practical, situational knowledge, trying to encompass the complexity of a medical condition.
Conclusions Knowing the patient is essential when dealing with comorbidities as well as with difficult relations in the consultations on exacerbations. This study suggests that it is crucial to improve the collaboration between primary and secondary care, in terms of, for example, shared consultations and defined work tasks, which may enhance shared knowledge of patients, medical decision-making and improved management planning.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

The cost of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has not been well studied. The aim of this study was to identify and quantify the (average) cost of moderate and severe exacerbations (ME and SE, respectively) from a Canadian perspective.


METHODS

Resources used during ME and SE were identified in a year long prospective, observational study (Resource Utilization Study In COPD (RUSIC)). The units of analysis were ME and SE. Unit costs (2006\$CAN), based on provincial, hospital and published sources, were applied to resources. The overall cost per ME and SE were calculated. The population burden of exacerbations was also calculated.


RESULTS

Among study participants (N=609, aged 68.6+/-9.4 years, 58.3\% male) there were 790 exacerbations: 639 (80.9\%) MEs and 151 (19.1\%) SEs. Of the 790 exacerbations, 618 (78.2\%), 245 (31.0\%) and 151 (19.1\%) included a visit to an outpatient clinic, emergency department (ED) or hospital, respectively. For ME, 85.9\% and 13.1\% involved visits to GPs and respirologists, respectively. Pharmacologic treatment changes in the outpatient setting involved antibiotics (63.1\%) and corticosteroids (34.7\%). The overall mean costs for outpatient and ED services for MEs were \$126 (N=574) and \$515 (N=105), respectively. The average overall cost of a ME was \$641. For SEs, the average hospital stay was 10.0 days. The overall mean costs of outpatient, ED and hospitalization services for SE were \$114 (N=44), \$774 (N=140) and \$8669 (N=151), respectively. The average overall cost of a SE was \$9557.


CONCLUSION

The economic burden associated with MEs and especially SEs, in Canada, is considerable and likely has a substantial impact on healthcare costs. The overall burden of exacerbations has been estimated in the range of \$646 million to \$736 million per annum.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States as well as throughout the rest of the world. An exacerbation of COPD (periodic escalations of symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and sputum production) is a major contributor to worsening lung function, impairment in quality of life, need for urgent care or hospitalization, and cost of care in COPD. Research conducted over the past decade has contributed much to our current understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of COPD. Additionally, an evolving literature has accumulated about the prevention of acute exacerbations.
METHODS: In recognition of the importance of preventing exacerbations in patients with COPD, the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) and Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) joint evidence-based guideline (AECOPD Guideline) was developed to provide a practical, clinically useful document to describe the current state of knowledge regarding the prevention of acute exacerbations according to major categories of prevention therapies. Three key clinical questions developed using the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome) format addressed the prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: nonpharmacologic therapies, inhaled therapies, and oral therapies. We used recognized document evaluation tools to assess and choose the most appropriate studies and to extract meaningful data and grade the level of evidence to support the recommendations in each PICO question in a balanced and unbiased fashion.
RESULTS: The AECOPD Guideline is unique not only for its topic, the prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD, but also for the first-in-kind partnership between two of the largest thoracic societies in North America. The CHEST Guidelines Oversight Committee in partnership with the CTS COPD Clinical Assembly launched this project with the objective that a systematic review and critical evaluation of the published literature by clinical experts and researchers in the field of COPD would lead to a series of recommendations to assist clinicians in their management of the patient with COPD.
CONCLUSIONS: This guideline is unique because it provides an up-to-date, rigorous, evidence-based analysis of current randomized controlled trial data regarding the prevention of COPD exacerbations.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The literature was reviewed to determine whether data support current treatment guideline recommendations regarding the use of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations.
SUMMARY: Exacerbations of COPD are common and can be detrimental to both patient health and health care costs. Corticosteroids are recommended by consensus guidelines for patients during exacerbations of COPD. Although guidelines make very specific recommendations, clinical data are conflicting and inconsistent. A search of the English-language medical literature was performed, and all randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials or meta-analyses that examined the use of systemic corticosteroids in COPD exacerbations were included. Trials that included nebulized corticosteroids were also included as long as they were compared to a systemic corticosteroid and a placebo. Recommendations regarding the use of systemic corticosteroids are not optimal or completely supported. Data support recommendations if patients are treated on an outpatient basis. However, hospitalized patients might also benefit from higher doses of systemic steroids initially, followed by an oral taper dose.
CONCLUSION: In the treatment of COPD exacerbations, systemic corticosteroids improve airflow limitations, decrease treatment failure rates, decrease the risk of relapse, and may improve symptoms and decrease the length of hospital stay. Because of the risks of adverse effects, the lowest dose and shortest duration of corticosteroid therapy that will provide therapeutic benefit should be chosen. The literature suggests that hospitalized patients should benefit from a higher initial dosage of systemic corticosteroids than the 30-40 mg of i.v. or oral prednisolone for 7-10 days recommended in current guidelines.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A key feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an accelerated rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), but data on the variability and determinants of this change in patients who have established disease are scarce.
METHODS: We analyzed the changes in FEV(1) after administration of a bronchodilator over a 3-year period in 2163 patients. A random-coefficient model was used to evaluate possible predictors of both FEV(1) levels and their changes over time.
RESULTS: The mean (±SE) rate of change in FEV(1) was a decline of 33±2 ml per year, with significant variation among the patients studied. The between-patient standard deviation for the rate of decline was 59 ml per year. Over the 3-year study period, 38\% of patients had an estimated decline in FEV(1) of more than 40 ml per year, 31\% had a decline of 21 to 40 ml per year, 23\% had a change in FEV(1) that ranged from a decrease of 20 ml per year to an increase of 20 ml per year, and 8\% had an increase of more than 20 ml per year. The mean rate of decline in FEV(1) was 21±4 ml per year greater in current smokers than in current nonsmokers, 13±4 ml per year greater in patients with emphysema than in those without emphysema, and 17±4 ml per year greater in patients with bronchodilator reversibility than in those without reversibility.
CONCLUSIONS: The rate of change in FEV(1) among patients with COPD is highly variable, with increased rates of decline among current smokers, patients with bronchodilator reversibility, and patients with emphysema.},

	abstract = {The rise in life expectancy worldwide has been accompanied by an increased incidence of age-related diseases, representing an enormous burden on healthcare services and society. All vital organs lose function with age, and this is well described in the lung, with a progressive decline in pulmonary function after the age of about 25 years. The lung ages, like any other organ, with progressive functional impairment and reduced capacity to respond to environmental stresses and injury. Normal physiological ageing results in enlarged alveolar spaces and loss of lung elasticity in the elderly known as ‘senile emphysema’, whereas in COPD there is destruction of the alveolar walls and fibrosis of peripheral airways. However, COPD shows striking age-associated features, such as an increase in cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, increased oxidative stress, alteration in the extracellular matrix and a reduction in endogenous antiageing molecules and protective pathways such as autophagy. In this review we discuss the evidence showing how oxidative stress induces accelerated ageing by upregulating the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase/AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin signalling pathway resulting in depletion of stem cells, defective autophagy, reduced antioxidant responses and defective mitochondrial function thus generating further oxidative stress. Understanding the mechanisms of accelerated ageing in COPD may identify novel therapeutic approaches.},

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe lung function changes in healthy never-smoking males and females, from adolescence to old age, and to determine the effects of smoking and those derived from quitting.
METHODS: Prospective cohort study within all participants of the Framingham Offspring cohort who had two or more valid spirometry measurements during follow-up (n = 4,391; age range at baseline 13 to 71 yr), with a median follow-up time of 23 years.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: To best fit the curves describing FEV(1) changes with age to raw data, we used a generalized additive model with smooth terms and incorporating the subject-specific (longitudinal) random effects. We found that: (1) healthy never-smoker females achieve full lung growth earlier than males, and their rate of decline with age was slightly, but not significantly, lower; (2) smoking increases the rate of lung function decline, both in males and in females; (3) there is a range of susceptibility to the effects of smoking. The presence of respiratory symptoms at baseline and/or a respiratory diagnosis during follow-up appears to identify a group of susceptible smokers; and (4) quitting smoking has a beneficial effect at any age, but it is more pronounced in earlier quitters.
CONCLUSIONS: Lung function changes from adolescence to old age differ in males and females, smoking has similar deleterious effects in both sexes, and quitting earlier is better.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Women's Health Initiative randomized trial found greater coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in women assigned to estrogen/progestin therapy than in those assigned to placebo. Observational studies had previously suggested reduced CHD risk in hormone users.
METHODS: Using data from the observational Nurses' Health Study, we emulated the design and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the randomized trial. The observational study was conceptualized as a sequence of "trials," in which eligible women were classified as initiators or noninitiators of estrogen/progestin therapy.
RESULTS: The ITT hazard ratios (HRs) (95\% confidence intervals) of CHD for initiators versus noninitiators were 1.42 (0.92-2.20) for the first 2 years, and 0.96 (0.78-1.18) for the entire follow-up. The ITT HRs were 0.84 (0.61-1.14) in women within 10 years of menopause, and 1.12 (0.84-1.48) in the others (P value for interaction = 0.08). These ITT estimates are similar to those from the Women's Health Initiative. Because the ITT approach causes severe treatment misclassification, we also estimated adherence-adjusted effects by inverse probability weighting. The HRs were 1.61 (0.97-2.66) for the first 2 years, and 0.98 (0.66-1.49) for the entire follow-up. The HRs were 0.54 (0.19-1.51) in women within 10 years after menopause, and 1.20 (0.78-1.84) in others (P value for interaction = 0.01). We also present comparisons between these estimates and previously reported Nurses' Health Study estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the discrepancies between the Women's Health Initiative and Nurses' Health Study ITT estimates could be largely explained by differences in the distribution of time since menopause and length of follow-up.},

	doi = {10.1056/NEJMoa1303342},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tiotropium delivered at a dose of 5 μg with the Respimat inhaler showed efficacy similar to that of 18 μg of tiotropium delivered with the HandiHaler inhalation device in placebo-controlled trials involving patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although tiotropium HandiHaler was associated with reduced mortality, as compared with placebo, more deaths were reported with tiotropium Respimat than with placebo.
METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial involving 17,135 patients with COPD, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of tiotropium Respimat at a once-daily dose of 2.5 μg or 5 μg, as compared with tiotropium HandiHaler at a once-daily dose of 18 μg. Primary end points were the risk of death (noninferiority study, Respimat at a dose of 5 μg or 2.5 μg vs. HandiHaler) and the risk of the first COPD exacerbation (superiority study, Respimat at a dose of 5 μg vs. HandiHaler). We also assessed cardiovascular safety, including safety in patients with stable cardiac disease.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 2.3 years, Respimat was noninferior to HandiHaler with respect to the risk of death (Respimat at a dose of 5 μg vs. HandiHaler: hazard ratio, 0.96; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.09; Respimat at a dose of 2.5 μg vs. HandiHaler: hazard ratio, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.87 to 1.14) and not superior to HandiHaler with respect to the risk of the first exacerbation (Respimat at a dose of 5 μg vs. HandiHaler: hazard ratio, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.93 to 1.03). Causes of death and incidences of major cardiovascular adverse events were similar in the three groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Tiotropium Respimat at a dose of 5 μg or 2.5 μg had a safety profile and exacerbation efficacy similar to those of tiotropium HandiHaler at a dose of 18 μg in patients with COPD. (Funded by Boehringer Ingelheim; TIOSPIR ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01126437.).},

Interventions LABA, LAMA and/or ICS, alone or in combination, versus each other or placebo.
Primary and secondary outcomes The proportion of patients with moderate-to-severe exacerbations. The number of patients experiencing mortality, pneumonia, serious arrhythmia and cardiovascular-related mortality (CVM) were secondary outcomes.
Results NMA was conducted including 20 RCTs for moderate-to-severe exacerbations for 26 141 patients with an exacerbation in the past year. 32 treatments were effective versus placebo including: tiotropium, budesonide/formoterol, salmeterol, indacaterol, fluticasone/salmeterol, indacaterol/glycopyrronium, tiotropium/fluticasone/salmeterol and tiotropium/budesonide/formoterol. Tiotropium/budesonide/formoterol was most effective (99.2\% probability of being the most effective according to the Surface Under the Cumulative RAnking (SUCRA) curve). NMA was conducted on mortality (88 RCTs, 97 526 patients); fluticasone/salmeterol was more effective in reducing mortality than placebo, formoterol and fluticasone alone, and was the most effective (SUCRA=71\%). NMA was conducted on CVM (37 RCTs, 55 156 patients) and the following were safest: salmeterol versus each OF placebo, tiotropium and tiotropium (Soft Mist Inhaler (SMR)); fluticasone versus tiotropium (SMR); and salmeterol/fluticasone versus tiotropium and tiotropium (SMR). Triamcinolone acetonide was the most harmful (SUCRA=81\%). NMA was conducted on pneumonia occurrence (54 RCTs, 61 551 patients). 24 treatments were more harmful, including 2 that increased risk of pneumonia versus placebo; fluticasone and fluticasone/salmeterol. The most harmful agent was fluticasone/salmeterol (SUCRA=89\%). NMA was conducted for arrhythmia; no statistically significant differences between agents were identified.
Conclusions Many inhaled agents are available for COPD, some are safer and more effective than others. Our results can be used by patients and physicians to tailor administration of these agents.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prevention and control of disease and injury require information about the leading medical causes of illness and exposures or risk factors. The assessment of the public-health importance of these has been hampered by the lack of common methods to investigate the overall, worldwide burden. The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) provides a standardised approach to epidemiological assessment and uses a standard unit, the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), to aid comparisons.
METHODS: DALYs for each age-sex group in each GBD region for 107 disorders were calculated, based on the estimates of mortality by cause, incidence, average age of onset, duration, and disability severity. Estimates of the burden and prevalence of exposure in different regions of disorders attributable to malnutrition, poor water supply, sanitation and personal and domestic hygiene, unsafe sex, tobacco use, alcohol, occupation, hypertension, physical inactivity, use of illicit drugs, and air pollution were developed.
FINDINGS: Developed regions account for 11.6\% of the worldwide burden from all causes of death and disability, and account for 90.2\% of health expenditure worldwide. Communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional disorders explain 43.9\%; non-communicable causes 40.9\%; injuries 15.1\%; malignant neoplasms 5.1\%; neuropsychiatric conditions 10.5\%; and cardiovascular conditions 9.7\% of DALYs worldwide. The ten leading specific causes of global DALYs are, in descending order, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, perinatal disorders, unipolar major depression, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, tuberculosis, measles, road-traffic accidents, and congenital anomalies. 15.9\% of DALYs worldwide are attributable to childhood malnutrition and 6.8\% to poor water, and sanitation and personal and domestic hygiene.
INTERPRETATION: The three leading contributors to the burden of disease are communicable and perinatal disorders affecting children. The substantial burdens of neuropsychiatric disorders and injuries are under-recognised. The epidemiological transition in terms of DALYs has progressed substantially in China, Latin America and the Caribbean, other Asia and islands, and the middle eastern crescent. If the burdens of disability and death are taken into account, our list differs substantially from other lists of the leading causes of death. DALYs provide a common metric to aid meaningful comparison of the burden of risk factors, diseases, and injuries.},

The objective of this study was to compare ICS users and non-users regarding bone mineral density (BMD) in a large population. A total of 65 225 adults participated in a cross-sectional study in the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study 1995–1997. Those reporting asthma or asthma-related symptoms, were invited to have bone densitometry of the forearm, flow volume spirometry and a personal interview. Altogether 4482 women and 4142 men participated, of whom 2113 reported ever use and 6511 never use of ICS. Never-users of corticosteroids had a mean BMD, adjusted for confounders (age, square age, sex, body mass index, height, physical activity, work load, packyears, family history of osteoporosis and in women number of years since menopause and use of hormone replacement therapy), of 0.493 g/cm2 at the distal site. Subjects having only used ICS or combined with courses of prednisolone, had 0.008 g/cm2 (95\%CI: 0.005–0.011) lower BMD whilst users of prednisolone ≥6 months had 0.038 g/cm2 (0.021–0.055) lower level. No dose response association between ICS and BMD, or difference in BMD by type of ICS was found. The association between CS use and BMD was independent of the measuring site. ICS use was associated with lower BMD. The lack of dose response in this study might be due to a narrow dose range or indicates that other characteristics of the patient group are contributing to the observed difference in ICS users compared to never-users.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Asthmatic patients taking low to moderate doses of inhaled topical corticosteroids have been shown to have lower bone density than those taking bronchodilators only. There is little information on bone density in asthmatic patients taking high dose inhaled corticosteroids. METHODS: Bone mass was studied in three age matched groups of asthmatic patients. These comprised: 17 asthmatic patients who had never taken inhaled or systemic corticosteroids (group 1); 20 patients who had taken beclomethasone diproprionate in a dosage of 1000-2000 micrograms daily for at least a year, who had also received courses of systemic corticosteroids in the past (group 2); and 20 patients who were taking both high dose inhaled corticosteroids and regular low dose prednisolone, at a median dose of 7 mg daily (group 3). Vertebral bone density was measured by quantitative computed tomography. Biochemical indices of bone formation and resorption were also measured. RESULTS: Mean bone density in group 2 (127.5(22.6) mg/ml) was similar to that in group 3 (114.5 (36.0) mg/ml). Bone density was significantly lower in both of these groups than in group 1 (160.4 (27.4) mg/ml). There were no significant differences between groups for any of the markers of bone formation and resorption. CONCLUSIONS: Asthmatic patients receiving high dose inhaled beclomethasone and intermittent courses of systemic corticosteroids have reduced vertebral bone density. The bone loss is similar in degree to that seen in patients taking high dose inhaled topical corticosteroids and continuous low dose systemic corticosteroids.},

	abstract = {Inhaled corticosteroids are widely used in the treatment of bronchial asthma, but it is still uncertain whether long-term use of the inhaled corticosteroids affects bone metabolism in asthmatic patients. In this study, we examined the effect of inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) on bone mineral density (BMD) and biochemical markers of bone metabolism in pre- and early postmenopausal asthmatic women. Thirty-six (17 premenopausal and 19 early postmenopausal) asthmatic women and 45 healthy control (24 premenopausal and 21 early postmenopausal) women were investigated. All the asthmatic patients were treated with BDP (542 +/- 298 microg/day; 100-1200 microg/day) without any systemic administration of corticosteroids for at least 1 year. In premenopausal women, BMD as well as the biochemical markers of bone metabolism did not differ between control subjects and BDP-treated asthmatic patients. By contrast, in early postmenopausal women, BMD was significantly lower in BDP-treated asthmatic patients than in control subjects. In these early postmenopausal women, serum intact osteocalcin concentration was lower in the BDP-treated asthmatic patients than in the control subjects whereas urinary free pyridinoline (F-PYD) and free deoxypyridinoline (F-DPD) concentrations did not differ between the groups. Thus, early postmenopausal, but not premenopausal, asthmatic patients who were treated with inhaled BDP had reduced BMD, which was associated with a decreased level of the bone formation marker. Ovarian hormones may be protective against the adverse effect of inhaled BDP on bone metabolism in the premenopausal patients.},

	issn = {0040-6376},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inhaled corticosteroids are clearly beneficial for patients with asthma of moderate severity, but the risks and benefits of using them in patients with milder asthma are less clear. We have compared the change in bone mineral density over 2 years in adults with mild asthma randomised to receive an inhaled corticosteroid or non-corticosteroid treatment.
METHODS: Subjects with mild asthma (mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) 86\% predicted, mean age 35 years, taking beta agonists only) were randomised to receive inhaled budesonide, inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate, or non-corticosteroid treatment for 2 years in a prospective randomised open study in 19 centres in France, New Zealand, Spain, and the UK. The corticosteroid dose was adjusted according to a written self-management plan. The main outcome measure-change in bone mineral density after 6, 12, and 24 months-was measured "blind". Secondary outcomes included lung function, the relation between change in bone density and inhaled steroid dose and change in biochemical markers of bone metabolism.
RESULTS: Of 374 subjects randomised, 239 (64\%) completed the study and were included in the analysis. The median daily doses of inhaled budesonide (n=87) and beclomethasone (n=74) were 389 microg and 499 microg, respectively. Subjects treated with an inhaled corticosteroid had better asthma control than those in the reference group (n=78). Change in bone mineral density did not differ between the three groups over the 2 years, nor did it correlate with changes in markers of bone metabolism. The mean change in bone mineral density over 2 years in the budesonide, beclomethasone dipropionate, and reference groups was 0.1\%, -0.4\%, and 0.4\% for the lumbar spine and -0.9\%, -0.9\%, and -0.4\% for neck of the femur. Mean daily dose of inhaled steroid was related to reduction in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine but not at the femoral neck.
CONCLUSION: In subjects with mild asthma an inhaled corticosteroid provided better asthma control than alternative non-corticosteroid treatment with no difference in change in bone mineral density over 2 years. The relation between dose of inhaled corticosteroid and change in bone density at the lumbar spine may be due to a direct effect of inhaled corticosteroids on bone. Since inhaled steroid dose is also related inversely to lung function, an effect of asthma severity on bone density was also possible.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Inhaled corticosteroids have become a key element in the maintenance treatment of bronchial asthma. Recent studies have shown that administration of inhaled corticosteroids is associated with evidence of derangement in bone turnover. Therefore, we studied the bone mineral density (BMD) of asthmatic women receiving long-term inhaled corticosteroids and compared them with healthy individuals matched for age, sex, menopausal status and body mass index.
METHODOLOGY: Thirty-two female patients with bronchial asthma, who had been using inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone dipropionate 750-1500 microg/day) regularly for at least 3 months, were included in the study. Bone mineral density measurements were done with dual X-ray absorptiometry in the lumbar area of the spine and the hip. Detailed laboratory examination was also done for the patients and 26 controls.
RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in BMD of the patient group at the lumbar region and femur as compared with normal controls. In the patients there was a significant negative correlation between the duration of therapy, daily and cumulative doses, and BMD at the lumbar region but not BMD at the femur.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids is associated with significant bone loss in asthmatic women and is especially related to the duration of therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to appropriately screen and give prophylactic treatment to those who are likely to develop osteoporosis from inhaled corticosteroid treatment.},

METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, regulatory documents and company registries were searched up to August 2010. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of budesonide or fluticasone versus control treatment for COPD (≥24 weeks duration) and controlled observational studies reporting on fracture risk with ICS exposure vs no exposure in COPD were included. Peto OR meta-analysis was used for fracture risk from RCTs while ORs from observational studies were pooled using the fixed effect inverse variance method. Dose-response analysis was conducted using variance-weighted least squares regression in the observational studies. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic.
RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs (14 fluticasone, 2 budesonide) with 17,513 participants, and seven observational studies (n=69,000 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. ICSs were associated with a significantly increased risk of fractures (Peto OR 1.27; 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.58; p=0.04; I(2)=0\%) in the RCTs. In the observational studies, ICS exposure was associated with a significantly increased risk of fractures (OR 1.21; 95\% CI 1.12 to 1.32; p{\textless}0.001; I(2)=37\%), with each 500 μg increase in beclomethasone dose equivalents associated with a 9\% increased risk of fractures, OR 1.09 (95\% CI 1.06 to 1.12; p{\textless}0.001).
CONCLUSION: Among patients with COPD, long-term exposure to fluticasone and budesonide is consistently associated with a modest but statistically significant increased likelihood of fractures.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION:
Prolonged use of oral corticosteroids is a risk factor for osteoporosis. However, the effect of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) on bone mineral density (BMD) of asthmatic patients remains controversial.

OBJECTIVES:
We aimed to determine the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in our patients with asthma receiving ICSs for more than one year compared with patients who did not have asthma and to determine the risk factors for osteopenia and osteoporosis among the asthmatic patients.

METHODS:
This was a cross-sectional study conducted from August 2007 to July 2009. Asthmatic patients aged 18 years and older who had been on ICS for at least one year and a control group of subjects not on ICS were included. BMD was measured using DEXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan. The WHO classification of T-scores for osteopenia and osteoporosis were used.

RESULTS:
A total of 143 subjects were recruited (69 asthmatics and 74 control subjects). T-scores of the spine, femur, and hip of the asthmatics vs the control subjects were mean, −0.72 vs −0.57 (P=0.98); median, −0.60 vs −0.80 (P=0.474); and mean, 0.19 vs 0.06 (P=0.275); respectively. T-scores of the spine, femur, and hip showed significant negative correlation with age and significant positive correlation with body mass index (BMI).

CONCLUSION:
The risk factors for osteoporosis and osteopenia among asthmatic patients were older age and lower BMI, but not the cumulative dose of ICS. Asthmatic patients on ICS have no added risk of osteoporosis or osteopenia as compared with non-asthmatic subjects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by a low-level systemic chronic inflammatory activity that is responsible for many of the disease's extra-pulmonary manifestations, including osteoporosis and fragility fractures. These manifestations are also well-documented side-effects of oral corticosteroids. It was hypothesized that low levels of inhaled corticosteroids, due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their low circulating levels, might preserve the bone mineral density (BMD) of COPD patients.
METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-one male ex-smokers with COPD patients grouped on the basis of their diffusion capacity value as predominantly bronchitic or predominantly emphysematic and 313 male controls with similar age and smoking history were enrolled in the study. Each of the patient's categories was randomized into two separate subgroups. Patients enrolled in subgroups B(neg) (n = 91, 36\%) and E(neg) (n = 37, 14.7\%) were treated with long-acting β2-agonists and anticholinergics, while subgroups B(ICS) (n = 87, 35\%) and E(ICS) (n = 38, 15.1\%) were additionally receiving low-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Patients and controls were evaluated by clinical examination, lung function testing and BMD measurement every 6 months for 4 years.
RESULTS: According to the findings, emphysematic patients demonstrated an increased rate of BMD loss compared with bronchitic patients (P = 0.01). Furthermore, a reduction of the annual BMD loss in bronchitic patients on inhaled corticosteroids (P = 0.02) was measured, without a corresponding benefit for the emphysematics (P = not significant).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term administration of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids decelerates the annual BMD loss in bronchitic patients, possibly by reducing both pulmonary and systemic chronic inflammation caused by COPD.},

	abstract = {Background: Asthma in elderly is increasing but still underdiagnosed and undertreated. Long term use of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) is the mainstay of treatment, which may affect bone mineral density. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of osteoporosis and relationship with clinical parameters, comorbid conditions and asthma control status in elderly asthma patients. Method: This is a retrospective, cross-sectional study. Clinically diagnosed as bronchial asthma patients were enrolled over 60 years old. In total 107 subjects were enrolled. Bone mineral density (BMD, g/ cm2) was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic Discovery A, Hologic, Bedford, MA, USA). Induced sputum analysis and lung function tests were conducted, and asthma control status was evaluated by asthma control test (ACT) score. Results: Mean age was 70.18 +/- 5.67. Seventy-two patients were female (67.3\%). Mean asthma duration was 10.00 +/- 10.13 years rangaed from 0.8 to 50 years. Sixty one (57.0\%) were in well control stauts (ACT {\textgreater} 20). Ninety two (86.0\%) were using ICS in which 21.6\% were using high dose ICS and 15.0\% had a history of systemic steroid (SS) use. Fifty patients (46.7\%) had osteoporosis (T score {\textless}-2.5), and 89 patients (83.2\%) had osteopenia (T score {\textless}-1.0). Among the patients with osteoporosis, female was predominant (74.2\% vs. 25.8\%, P = 0.001). Moreover, mean BMD was significantly lower in female (P = 0.001). The patients with osteoporosis had significantly higher comorbidities (P = 0.039) with a negative correlation between number of comorbidities and BMD level (P = 0.024). ICS and SS use was not significantly associated with the prevalence of osteoporosis or osteopenia and no significant differences were noted in BMD level whether the patients were using ICS or SS use. However, the patients with early onset asthma had lower BMD (P = 0.046). No significant associations were found between presence of osteoporosis/ osteopenia and asthma control status, FEV1 level and sputum inflammatory cell profiles (P {\textgreater} 0.05, respectively). Conclusion: Osteoporosis and osteopenia are very prevalent comorbid condition in elderly asthma, particularly in female patients. We suggest that multiple comorbidies in elderly asthma is a risk for osteoporosis.},

They include the g-computation formula, inverse probability weighted estimation of marginal structural models and g-estimation of structural nested models.

We examined the excess direct medical costs, including asthma- and comorbidity-related costs, in patients with asthma.We created a propensity score-matched cohort of patients newly diagnosed with asthma and non-asthmatic comparison subjects, both aged 5-55 years, from health administrative data (1997-2012) in British Columbia, Canada. Health services use records were categorised into 16 major disease categories based on International Classification of Diseases codes. Excess costs (in 2013 Canadian dollars (\$)) were estimated as the adjusted difference in direct medical costs between the two groups.Average overall excess costs were estimated at \$1058/person-year (95\% CI 1006-1110), of which \$134 (95\% CI 132-136) was attributable to asthma and \$689 (95\% CI 649-730) to major comorbidity classes. Psychiatric disorders were the largest component of excess comorbidity costs, followed by digestive disorders, diseases of the nervous system, and respiratory diseases other than asthma. Comorbidity-attributable excess costs greatly increased with age but did not increase over the time course of asthma.These findings suggest that both asthma and comorbidity-related outcomes should be considered in formulating evidence-based policies and guidelines for asthma management.},

It is not clear if the secondary care provided by specialists after an episode of asthma-related hospitalization is associated with better outcomes compared with the primary care provided by general practitioners.
METHODS: Using population-based administrative health data from the province of British Columbia, Canada, we created a propensity-score-matched cohort of individuals who received primary vs secondary care in the 60 days after discharge from asthma-related hospitalization. Total direct asthma-related medical costs (primary outcome) and health service use and measures of medication adherence (secondary outcomes) were compared for the next 12 months.
RESULTS: Two thousand eighty-eight individuals were equally matched between the primary and secondary care groups. There was no difference in the direct asthma-related costs (difference \$567; 95\% CI, -\$276 to \$1,410) and rate of readmission (rate ratio [RR] = 1.06; 95\% CI, 0.85-1.32) between the secondary and the primary care groups. Patients under secondary care had a higher rate of asthma-related outpatient service use (RR = 1.22; 95\% CI, 1.11-1.35) but a lower rate of short-acting β-agonist dispensation (RR = 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.85-0.98). The proportion of days covered with a controller medication was higher among the secondary care group (difference of 3.2\%; 95\% CI, 0.4\%-6.0\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with those who received only primary care, patients who received secondary care showed evidence of more appropriate treatment. Nevertheless, there were no differences in the costs or the risk of readmission. Adherence to asthma medication in both groups was poor, indicating the need for raising the quality of care provided by generalists and specialists alike.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To measure the prevalence rate of significant depressive symptoms and depression and examine their consequences on quality of life in patients with severe oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: Between November 1997 and March 1998, the authors conducted a cross-sectional study among the COPD patients registered at the Quebec City area respiratory home care service. Depression and quality of life were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Medical Outcome Survey--Short Form 36 (SF-36).
RESULTS: 109 patients (63 men; mean age: 71) with severe COPD (median FEV1: 34\%) were surveyed. Of them, 105 were on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), which had been introduced (median) 19 months earlier. Sixty-two patients (57\%; 95\% Cl: 47-66) demonstrated significant depressive symptoms; in addition, 20 patients (18\%; Cl: 12-27) were severely depressed. Only 6\% of those patients who met the criteria for depression were taking an antidepressant drug. We found significant and moderate correlations between the scores obtained from the Geriatric Depression Scale and 7 of the 8 domains of the SF-36.
CONCLUSION: Significant depressive symptoms and depression are highly prevalent in patients with severe COPD on LTOT. There is strong evidence that depression is under-recognized and under-treated in this group of patients.},

Alveolar hypoxia and consequent hypoxemia increase in prevalence as disease severity increases. Ventilation/perfusion mismatch resulting from progressive airflow limitation and emphysema is the key driver of this hypoxia, which may be exacerbated by sleep and exercise. Uncorrected chronic hypoxemia is associated with the development of adverse sequelae of COPD, including pulmonary hypertension, secondary polycythemia, systemic inflammation, and skeletal muscle dysfunction. A combination of these factors leads to diminished quality of life, reduced exercise tolerance, increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity, and greater risk of death. Concomitant sleep-disordered breathing may place a small but significant subset of COPD patients at increased risk of these complications. Long-term oxygen therapy has been shown to improve pulmonary hemodynamics, reduce erythrocytosis, and improve survival in selected patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. However, the optimal treatment for patients with exertional oxyhemoglobin desaturation, isolated nocturnal hypoxemia, or mild-to-moderate resting daytime hypoxemia remains uncertain.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The morbidity and mortality associated with COPD exacts a considerable economic burden. Comorbidities in COPD are associated with poor health outcomes and increased costs. Our objective was to assess the impact of comorbidities on COPD-associated costs in a large administrative claims dataset.
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of data from the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters and the MarketScan Medicare Supplemental Databases from January 1, 2009, to September 30, 2012. Resource consumption was measured from the index date (date of first occurrence of non-rule-out COPD diagnosis) to 360 days after the index date. Resource use (all-cause and disease-specific [ie, COPD- or asthma-related] ED visits, hospitalizations, office visits, other outpatient visits, and total length of hospital stay) and health-care costs (all-cause and disease-specific costs for ED visits, hospitalizations, office visits, and other outpatient visits and medical, prescription, and total health-care costs) were assessed. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate the impact of comorbidities on total health-care costs, adjusting for age, sex, geographic location, baseline health-care use, employment status, and index COPD medication.
RESULTS: Among 183,681 patients with COPD, the most common comorbidities were cardiovascular disease (34.8\%), diabetes (22.8\%), asthma (14.7\%), and anemia (14.2\%). Most patients (52.8\%) had one or two comorbidities of interest. The average all-cause total health-care costs from the index date to 360 days after the index date were highest for patients with chronic kidney disease (\$41,288) and anemia (\$38,870). The impact on total health-care costs was greatest for anemia (\$10,762 more, on average, than a patient with COPD without anemia).
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrated that high resource use and costs were associated with COPD and multiple comorbidities.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To characterize a comprehensive comorbidity profile and to explore the economic implications of comorbidity among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed medical claims from the Maryland Medicaid database. We employed a 1:2 case-control design to select COPD patients (n=1388) and demographically matched controls (n=2776) aged 40 to 64 years with 24 months of continuous enrollment. Odds ratios were employed to compare comorbidity differences, including 17 conditions defined by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and 6 additional conditions commonly observed in COPD patients. We estimated the incremental medical utilization and medical cost by specific condition.
RESULTS: Compared with the controls, Medicaid COPD patients had higher comorbidity burden and were more likely to have myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, peptic ulcer, mild liver disease, hypertension, sleep apnea, tobacco use, and edema. COPD patients on average had 24\% more medical claims (81.4 vs. 65.4, p{\textless}0.001) and were 33\% more expensive than controls (\$7603 vs. \$5732, p{\textless}0.001). Ten conditions defined by the CCI as well as hypertension, tobacco use, and edema were associated with incremental medical utilization and cost in COPD patients; depression was associated with incremental medical utilization but not cost.
CONCLUSIONS: The high burden of comorbidity in COPD patients translates into additional medical utilization and cost. Effective disease management and treatment protocols are needed to reduce comorbidity burden. The development of a COPD-specific comorbidity measure may be used to identify high-risk subgroups and to predict utilization and cost.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of mortality and of loss of disability-adjusted life years worldwide. It often is accompanied by the presence of comorbidity.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the influence of COPD comorbidity on generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
METHODS: A systematic review approach was used to search the databases Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane Library for studies evaluating the influence of comorbidity on HRQoL in COPD. Identified studies were analyzed according to study characteristics, generic HRQoL measurement instrument, COPD severity and comorbid HRQoL impact. Studies using only non-generic instruments were excluded.
RESULTS: 25 studies met the selection criteria. Seven studies utilized the EQ-5D, six studies each used the SF-36 or SF-12. The remaining studies used one of six other instruments each. Utilities were calculated by four EQ-5D studies and one 15D study. Patient populations covered both early and advanced stages of COPD and ranged from populations with mostly stage 1 and 2 to studies with patients classified mainly stage 3 and 4. Evidence was mainly created for cardiovascular disease, depression and anxiety as well as diabetes but also for quantitative comorbid associations. Strong evidence is pointing towards the significant negative association of depression and anxiety on reduced HRQoL in COPD patients. While all studies found the occurrence of specific comorbidities to decrease HRQoL in COPD patients, the orders of magnitude diverged. Due to different patient populations, different measurement tools and different concomitant diseases the study heterogeneity was high.
CONCLUSIONS: Facilitating multimorbid intervention guidance, instead of applying a parsimony based single disease paradigm, should constitute an important goal for improving HRQoL of COPD patients in research and in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents an increasing burden throughout the world. COPD-related mortality is probably underestimated because of the difficulties associated with identifying the precise cause of death. Respiratory failure is considered the major cause of death in advanced COPD. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and lung cancer are also major causes and, in mild-to-moderate COPD, are the leading causes of mortality. The links between COPD and these conditions are not fully understood. However, a link through the inflammation pathway has been suggested, as persistent low-grade pulmonary and systemic inflammation, both known risk factors for cardiovascular disease and cancer, are present in COPD independent of cigarette smoking. Lung-specific measurements, such as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), predict mortality in COPD and in the general population. However, composite tools, such as health-status measurements (e.g. St George's Respiratory Questionnaire) and the BODE index, which incorporates Body mass index, lung function (airflow Obstruction), Dyspnoea and Exercise capacity, predict mortality better than FEV(1) alone. These multidimensional tools may be more valuable because, unlike predictive approaches based on single parameters, they can reflect the range of comorbidities and the complexity of underlying mechanisms associated with COPD. The current paper reviews the role of comorbidities in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality, the putative underlying pathogenic link between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and comorbid conditions (i.e. inflammation), and the tools used to predict chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality.},

Using the 2001-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey we characterized the association between thirteen co-morbidities and health status among individuals self-reporting COPD. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were generated using ordinal logistic regression. Additionally we evaluated the impact of increasing number of co-morbidities with self-rated health. Eight illnesses had significant associations with worse self-rated health, however after mutually adjusting for these conditions, congestive heart failure (OR 3.07, 95\% CI 1.69-5.58), arthritis (OR 1.69, 95\% CI 1.13-2.52), diabetes (OR 1.63, 95\% CI 1.01-2.64), and incontinence/prostate disease (OR 1.63, 95\% CI 1.01-2.62) remained independent predictors of self-rated health. Each increase in co-morbidities was associated with a 43\% higher chance of worse self-rated health (95\% CI 1.27-1.62). Individuals with COPD have a substantial burden of co-morbidity, which is associated with worse self-rated health. CHF, arthritis, diabetes and incontinence/prostate disease have the most impact on self-rated health. Targeting these co-morbidities in COPD may result in improved self-rated health.},

	abstract = {Introduction In the UK, there is significant variation in respiratory care and outcomes. An integrated approach to the management of high-risk respiratory patients, incorporating specialist and primary care teams' expertise, is the basis for new integrated respiratory services designed to reduce this variation; however, this model needs evaluating.
Methods To evaluate an integrated service managing high-risk respiratory patients, electronic searches for patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at risk of poor outcomes were performed in two general practitioner (GP) practices in a local service-development initiative. Patients were reviewed at joint clinics by primary and secondary care professionals. GPs also nominated patients for inclusion. Reviews were delivered to best standards of care including assessments of diagnosis, control, spirometry, self-management, education, medication, inhaler technique and smoking cessation support. Follow-up of routine clinical data collected at 9-months postclinic were compared with seasonally matched 9-months prior to integrated review.
Results 82 patients were identified, 55 attended. 13 (23.6\%) had their primary diagnosis changed. In comparison with the seasonally adjusted baseline period, in the 9-month follow-up there was an increase in inhaled corticosteroid prescriptions of 23.3\%, a reduction in short-acting β2-agonist prescription of 33.3\%, a reduction in acute respiratory exacerbations of 67.6\%, in unscheduled GP surgery visits of 53.3\% and acute respiratory hospital admissions reduced from 3 to 0. Only 4 patients (7.3\%) required referral to secondary care. Health economic evaluation showed respiratory-related costs per patient reduced by £231.86.
Conclusions Patients with respiratory disease in this region at risk of suboptimal outcomes identified proactively and managed by an integrated team improved outcomes without the need for hospital referral.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify if there is a dose-dependent risk of diabetes complications in patients treated with corticosteroids who have both diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective study of administrative claims data from the Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs, from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2008, of diabetes patients newly initiated on metformin or sulfonylurea. COPD was identified by dispensings of tiotropium or ipratropium in the 6 months preceding study entry. Total corticosteroid use (inhaled and systemic) in the 12 months after study entry was determined. The outcome was time to hospitalization for a diabetes-related complication. Competing risks and Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were conducted with adjustment for a number of covariates.
RESULTS: A total of 18,226 subjects with diabetes were identified, of which 5.9\% had COPD. Of those with COPD, 67.2\% were dispensed corticosteroids in the 12 months from study entry. Stratification by dose of corticosteroids demonstrated a 94\% increased likelihood of hospitalization for a diabetes complication for those who received a total defined daily dose (DDD) of corticosteroids≥0.83/day (subhazard ratio 1.94 [95\% CI 1.14-3.28], P=0.014), by comparison with those who did not receive a corticosteroid. Lower doses of corticosteroid ({\textless}0.83 DDD/day) were not associated with an increased risk of diabetes-related hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with diabetes and COPD, an increased risk of diabetes-related hospitalizations was only evident with use of high doses of corticosteroids. This highlights the need for constant revision of corticosteroid dose in those with diabetes and COPD, to ensure that the minimally effective dose is used, together with review of appropriate response to therapy.},

	abstract = {AIM: To see if home telemonitors reduce healthcare use in those with optimized chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: We randomized 40 stable patients with moderate to severe COPD, who had completed at least 12 sessions of outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), to receive standard care (Controls) for 52 weeks or standard care plus Docobo HealthHUB monitors at home for 26 weeks followed by 26 weeks standard care (Tm Group). During the monitoring period, the Tm Group completed symptoms and physical observations twice daily which were stored and then uploaded at 2 am through a freephone landline. Nurses could access the data through a secure web site and received alerting e-mails if certain combinations of data occurred.
RESULTS: There were fewer primary care contacts for chest problems (p {\textless} 0.03) in the Tm group, but no differences between the groups in emergency room visits, hospital admissions, days in hospital or contacts to the specialist COPD community nurse team, during the monitoring period. After the monitors were removed, there were no differences between the groups for any of the health care contacts (p {\textgreater} 0.20 throughout).
CONCLUSION: In stable, optimized COPD patients who have already completed PR, telemonitoring in addition to best care, reduces primary care chest contacts but not hospital or specialist team utilization.},

AIM: The purpose of this study aimed to undertake preliminary testing of an intervention of nurse-led community care program, the Network Collaborative Action Plan (N-CAP), to assess the impact on disease severity and patient satisfaction.
METHOD: A quasi-experimental study, using historical controls, evaluated a collaborative nurse-led intervention to promote coordination and continuity of care for patients with chronic illness.
RESULTS: Participants, diagnosed with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), coronary heart disease (CHD) and chronic heart failure (CHF) were recruited. Prospective consecutive patient meeting the study criteria (n=47) were assigned into the control group and following development and implementation of the intervention eligible consenting patients were enrolled in the experimental group (n=44). Participants in the experimental group had significantly tower scores on severity of disease measurements during the third week (F = 4.61, p = 0.035) and the eighth week hospital (F = 4.30, p = .041) following hospital discharge than those in the control group. Participants in the experimental group expressed significantly higher scores on satisfaction with community care than those in the control group.

Having symptoms of chronic bronchitis alone increases the risk of coronary deaths by 50\%. Reduced ratio of FEV1 to FVC by itself is a modest independent risk factor for coronary events, increasing the risk by 30\%. However, if patients have ventricular arrhythmias, the risk of coronary events is increased twofold, suggesting that the cardiotoxic effects of obstructive airways disease are amplified in those who have underlying cardiac rhythm disturbances. In general, for every 10\% decrease in FEV1, all-cause mortality increases by 14\%, cardiovascular mortality increases by 28\%, and nonfatal coronary event increases by almost 20\%.

Although traditionally therapeutic nihilism has dominated the approach to the management of COPD patients, it is becoming increasingly clear that COPD is a highly preventable and treatable condition. Smoking cessation is the most important therapy because it is the only intervention that has been shown to modify the accelerated decline in lung function that is characteristic of COPD. Domiciliary oxygen therapy for those who are hypoxemic at rest results in improved survival. Vaccinations and immunizations against influenza and pneumococcus should be encouraged. Bronchodilators are used for symptomatic relief. Recent introduction of long-acting bronchodilators facilitates good control of dyspnea with once or twice daily dosing. In conjunction with inhaled corticosteroids, they appear to produce added clinical benefits. Pulmonary rehabilitation and lung transplantation are other therapeutic options for select groups of patients. Many promising compounds are in various stages of development as future therapies in COPD. Drugs such as phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, tyrosine kinase blockers and peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma receptor agonists show great promise as disease-modifying agents in COPD.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
Comorbidities are frequent in subjects with COPD, but their contribution to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impairment is not clearly established.
Methods
Cross-sectional analysis of data from the French COPD cohort Initiatives BPCO. Data were recorded in stable state and included spirometry, dyspnea (modified Medical Research Council – mMRC-scale), mood disorders (hospital anxiety–depression scale) and physician-diagnosed comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, venous thromboembolism. HRQoL was assessed using the disease-specific St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Stepwise forward and backward multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the contribution of comorbidities to SGRQ scores.
Results
Data are median [IQR]. 326 COPD subjects were analyzed: male 77\%, age 65.0 [57.0; 72.0] years, FEV1 48.9 [34.7; 65.9]\% predicted. SGRQ total score was 44.2 [30.0; 61.2]. In univariate analysis, positive correlations were found between SGRQ total scores and dyspnea and exacerbations/patient/year, whereas negative correlations were found with FEV1. SGRQ total scores were increased in women (P = 0.06), and in subjects with low BMI, anxiety or depression (each analysis, P \&lt; 0.001), but not in subjects with cardiovascular comorbidities or diabetes. In multivariate analyses, major independent determinants of SGRQ total score included dyspnea, exacerbations/patient/year and depression. Low BMI, coronary artery disease and FEV1 were also independently associated with SGRQ total score, but their contribution was only modest.
Conclusions
These data suggest that in the presence of dyspnea and exacerbation, depression is the most important contributor to HRQoL impairment measured by SGRQ in COPD subjects, whereas other comorbidities and FEV1 have only limited impact.},

Age and smoking are common risk factors for COPD and other illnesses, often leading COPD patients to demonstrate multiple coexisting comorbidities. COPD exacerbations and comorbidities contribute to the overall severity in individual patients.

Clinical practice guidelines for a specific disease do not usually address comorbidities in their recommendations. However, the management and the medical intervention in COPD patients with comorbidities need a holistic approach that is not clearly established worldwide. This holistic approach should include the specific burden of each comorbidity in the COPD severity classification scale. Further, the pharmacological and nonpharmacological management should also include optimal interventions and risk factor modifications simultaneously for all diseases.

AIMS: To investigate through endoscopic examination the frequency of gastroduodenal disorder associated with buffered and enteric-coated aspirin (ECA).
METHODS: Screening upper endoscopic examinations were prospectively performed on 236 patients with ischemic heart disease. Endoscopic findings including ulcers and flat erosions were assessed as mucosal defects.
RESULTS: Mucosal defects were found in 92 of 190 (48.4\%) users of low-dose aspirin and 6 of 46 (13.0\%) nonusers. There were significantly more mucosal defects among users of low-dose aspirin than among those using no aspirin (P{\textless}0.0001). Mucosal defects were found in 54 of 98 (60.7\%) users of buffered aspirin (BA), whereas 38 of 101 (37.6\%) users of ECA had mucosal defects. Users of ECA had significantly fewer erosions than did those of BA (P=0.0015). The frequency of ulcer is similar between BA users and ECA users.
CONCLUSIONS: As endoscopy frequently reveals gastroduodenal disorder among low-dose aspirin users, both administration of BA and of enteric-coated aspirin warrant concern for gastroduodenal ulcer.},

We applied dexamethasone (0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg/day) intragastrically in rats with acetic acid-induced gastric ulcer. The mucosal prostaglandin E(2) level and protein expressions of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at the ulcer margin were determined. Ulcer induction significantly increased protein expressions of bFGF, VEGF, and prostaglandin E(2) level at the ulcer margin together with angiogenesis at the ulcer margin and base. The non-ulcerogenic doses of dexamethasone inhibited angiogenesis at the ulcer margin and ulcer base and delayed ulcer healing. These were associated with a significant decrease of prostaglandin E(2) level and VEGF expression, but not the bFGF expression. Supplementation with prostaglandin E(2) attenuated the inhibitory action of dexamethasone on VEGF expression and reversed the adverse effects of dexamethasone on angiogenesis and ulcer healing, without influencing bFGF expression. We concluded that dexamethasone given at non-ulcerogenic doses could decrease angiogenesis and delay acetic acid-induced ulcer healing; these actions were at least, in part, due to depletion of prostaglandin E(2) level followed by down-regulation of VEGF at the ulcer margin of the stomach.},

The main objective of this study was to estimate annual direct health-care costs, divided into costs due to non-respiratory and respiratory conditions, comparing subjects with and without COPD.
METHODS: Subjects with and without COPD derived from population-based cohorts in northern Sweden have been invited to annual examinations involving spirometry and structured interviews since 2005. This paper is based on data from 1472 subjects examined in 2006. COPD classification was based on spirometry.
RESULTS: Mean annual costs for both respiratory and non-respiratory conditions were significantly higher for subjects with COPD than non-COPD subjects, in total USD 2139 vs. USD 1276 (p = 0.026), and COPD remained significantly associated with higher costs also after adjustment for common confounders as age, smoking habits, BMI and sex. The mean total cost increased with COPD disease severity and was higher for all severity stages (GOLD) than for non-COPD subjects. Hospitalization due to non-respiratory diseases was the main cost driver in COPD, after adjustment for common confounders amounting to about 46\% (unadjusted 62\%) of the total COPD-costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Costs were higher for COPD than non-COPD. In COPD, costs for co-morbid conditions were higher than those for respiratory conditions, and hospitalization due to co-morbid conditions was the main cost driver also when adjusted for common confounders.},

	abstract = {There is significant evidence supporting an increased prevalence of depression in patients with COPD, but that depression is not a homogenous entity because there are multiple contributing etiologies for the depressive symptoms. Additionally the relationship between COPD and depression is neither exclusively linear, nor unidirectional. “Early onset” depression is defined as depression that develops prior to the diagnosis of COPD, often during an individual’s youth. This is often reflective of a genetic vulnerability to depression which increases adolescents’ risk for developing addiction to nicotine, setting up a life-long exposure to tobacco – the single greatest risk factor for the development of COPD. When COPD does develop it brings with it attendant losses, particularly in level of independent function and self image that contribute to a “reactive” depression that is not distinct from the losses experienced by those suffering with other chronic illnesses. Lastly there is increasing evidence through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biochemical markers that systemic, physiologic changes associated with COPD have direct effects on the brain’s vasculature that have also been associated with depression in the elderly, termed “late onset” depression. The conclusion is that the presence of depression in a COPD patient does not reflect a single pathologic pathway. Rather the two disorders each contribute to the morbidity of the other. This review discusses the evidence supporting each of these contributors and suggests that an understanding of these varying elements can direct healthcare interventions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-acting beta-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids are used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but their effect on survival is unknown.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial comparing salmeterol at a dose of 50 microg plus fluticasone propionate at a dose of 500 microg twice daily (combination regimen), administered with a single inhaler, with placebo, salmeterol alone, or fluticasone propionate alone for a period of 3 years. The primary outcome was death from any cause for the comparison between the combination regimen and placebo; the frequency of exacerbations, health status, and spirometric values were also assessed.
RESULTS: Of 6112 patients in the efficacy population, 875 died within 3 years after the start of the study treatment. All-cause mortality rates were 12.6\% in the combination-therapy group, 15.2\% in the placebo group, 13.5\% in the salmeterol group, and 16.0\% in the fluticasone group. The hazard ratio for death in the combination-therapy group, as compared with the placebo group, was 0.825 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.681 to 1.002; P=0.052, adjusted for the interim analyses), corresponding to a difference of 2.6 percentage points or a reduction in the risk of death of 17.5\%. The mortality rate for salmeterol alone or fluticasone propionate alone did not differ significantly from that for placebo. As compared with placebo, the combination regimen reduced the annual rate of exacerbations from 1.13 to 0.85 and improved health status and spirometric values (P{\textless}0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). There was no difference in the incidence of ocular or bone side effects. The probability of having pneumonia reported as an adverse event was higher among patients receiving medications containing fluticasone propionate (19.6\% in the combination-therapy group and 18.3\% in the fluticasone group) than in the placebo group (12.3\%, P{\textless}0.001 for comparisons between these treatments and placebo).
CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in death from all causes among patients with COPD in the combination-therapy group did not reach the predetermined level of statistical significance. There were significant benefits in all other outcomes among these patients. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00268216 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).},

	abstract = {Background
Low body mass index (BMI) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was found to be more prevalent in severe stages and was associated with poor prognosis and poor survival.
Aim
To find out the relation between BMI and GOLD stage (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) of COPD patients.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study among 154 patients of COPD, attending the chest medicine department in our medical college during the period from January 2014 to November 2015. We classify the severity of obstruction in COPD patients according to GOLD staging through spirometry. BMI of all the patients was measured. Correlation between BMI and severity of obstruction (post bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1st second (FEV1)\% predicted) in COPD patients was determined.
Results
The mean age of all of the patients was 57.18 (SD±10.7) years. There were 115 (74.4\%) males and 39 (25.3\%) females. The COPD patients were classified by their post-bronchodilator FEV1\% predicted in four stages according to GOLD staging. Among 154 study population, 3 (1.9\%) patients were in stage 1, 54 (35.1\%) in stage 2, 55 (35.7\%) in stage 3, and 42 (27.3\%) in stage 4. Applying the Pearson correlation test we found that BMI and post FEV1\% predicted were positively correlated (R=0.295, P{\textless}0.05). By applying the same test on GOLD stage and BMI, they were found to be negatively correlated (R=−0.3, P{\textless}0.05). Now by applying a one-way ANOVA, we found that BMI of the patients was decreasing with severity of the disease (GOLD) and it was statistically significant (F=4.116, P{\textless}0.05).
Conclusion
There was positive correlation between severity of airway obstruction and BMI in COPD patients.},

In this cross-sectional study we measured bone density with ultrasound and lung function with spirometry in 370 university students (271 girls and 99 boys). Information on lifestyle habits, such as physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption were obtained with a questionnaire. All lung function and bone parameters were significantly higher in boys than in girls (P{\textless}0.001). Underweight students had a significantly lower forced vital capacity (FVC\%) (P=0.001 girls; P=0.012 boys), while overweight students had a significantly higher FVC\% than normal weight students (P=0.024 girls; P=0.001 boys). BMI significantly correlated with FVC\% (P=0.001) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 \%) in both genders (P=0.001 girls; P=0.018 boys) and with broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) in boys. There were no significant associations between any of the bone and lung function parameters either in boys or girls.

	doi = {10.1111/all.13242},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies have shown that body mass index (BMI) is positively associated with asthma. However, observational data are prone to confounding and reverse causation. In Mendelian randomization, genetic variants are used as unconfounded markers of exposures to examine causal effects. We examined the causal effect of BMI on asthma, hay fever, allergic sensitization, serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE), forced expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC).
METHODS: We included 490 497 participants in the observational and 162 124 participants in the genetic analyses. A genetic risk score (GRS) was created using 26 BMI-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Results were pooled in meta-analyses and expressed as odds ratios (ORs) or β-estimates with 95\% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: The GRS was significantly associated with asthma (OR=1.009; 95\% CI: 1.004, 1.013), but not with hay fever (OR= 0.998; 95\% CI: 0.994, 1.002) or allergic sensitization (OR=0.999; 95\% CI: 0.986, 1.012) per BMI-increasing allele. The GRS was significantly associated with decrease in FEV1: β=-0.0012 (95\% CI: -0.0019, -0.0006) and FVC: β=-0.0022 (95\% CI: -0.0031, -0.0014) per BMI-increasing allele. Effect sizes estimated by instrumental variable analyses were OR=1.07 (95\% CI: 1.03, 1.10) for asthma, a 9 ml decrease in FEV1 (95\% CI: 2.0-15 mL decrease) and a 16 ml decrease in FVC (95\% CI: 7.0-24 mL decrease) per 1 kg/m2 higher BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: The results support the conclusion that increasing BMI is causally related to higher prevalence of asthma and decreased lung function, but not with hay fever or biomarkers of allergy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have documented the prognostic value of low body weight in patients with COPD and also in general populations. However, it is not clear whether low body weight is a risk factor for COPD or a consequence of established disease.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether asymptomatic subjects with low initial body mass were at a greater risk of having COPD develop during subsequent follow-up.
DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Observational retrospective study of 458 male and 192 female participants (age range, 40 to 73 years) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. At baseline, the participants did not have COPD. After mean follow-up periods of 10.2 years for the men and 6.4 years for the women, 40 men and 7 women received a diagnosis of COPD.
METHODS: Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to assess the relationship between COPD diagnosis and baseline body mass index (BMI) in men.
RESULTS: The risk of COPD developing in men varied inversely with baseline BMI, even after adjusting for other risk factors, including cigarette smoking, age, FEV(1) percent predicted, abdominal obesity, and educational status. In men, the relative risk of COPD developing for the lowest BMI tertile relative to the highest tertile was 2.76 (95\% confidence interval, 1.15 to 6.59). The small number of women who had COPD did not allow us to draw conclusions regarding BMI as a risk factor for COPD.
CONCLUSION: After controlling for confounding variables, men with low BMI are at increased risk for getting COPD.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of an interdisciplinary protocol for treating obesity in a group of patients with BMI {\textgreater} or = 35 and with altered respiratory function that was not necessarily related to obesity or not.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: Forty obese individuals between 18 and 60 years of age with altered respiratory function were enrolled. Spirometric values, plethysmograph volumes, arterial blood gases, and nighttime respiratory polygraphs were recorded. Following psychological and nutritional evaluation, the patients commenced year-long treatment for obesity involving a personalized diet and psychological counseling. Follow-up was weekly and individualized at first; in later sessions, patients were grouped. Lung function tests were repeated after loss of 5 kg. Sleep polygraphy was repeated after loss of 10 kg.
RESULTS: Weight loss over 15 kg was achieved by 48.6\% of the patients. Respiratory function variables: FVC, FEV1, RV, ERV, PaO2 and SatO2 after treatment changed significantly from initial levels. Significant differences were also seen in the severity of sleep apnea and pressures needed for continuous positive airway pressure. Uric acid, glucose and triglyceride blood levels became normal in 89\%, 61\% and 50\% of the patients, respectively, after weight loss. No characteristic psychological profile was identified for severe obesity, although levels of anxiety, eating behavior, marital adjustment and perception of body image were aspects that were fundamentally altered.
CONCLUSIONS: In the difficult group of obese patients with BMI {\textgreater} or = 35, interdisciplinary treatment has proven effective for achieving substantial weight loss, while improving respiratory function and severity of sleep disorder. This therapy, which is at present viable for few centers, deserves consideration in the interest of benefiting the increasing number of obese patients.},

	abstract = {Background
Lung function at the end of life depends on its peak and subsequent decline. Because obesity is epidemic in young adulthood, we quantified age-related changes in lung function relative to body mass index (BMI).

Methods
The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study in 1985–86 (year 0) recruited 5,115 black and white men and women, aged 18–30. Spirometry testing was conducted at years 0, 2, 5 and 10. We estimated 10 year change in FVC, FEV1 and FEV1/FVC according to baseline BMI and change in BMI within birth cohorts with initial average ages 20, 24, and 28 years, controlling for race, sex, smoking, asthma, physical activity, and alcohol consumption.

Measurements and Main Results
Participants with baseline BMI {\textless} 21.3 kg/m2 experienced 10 year increases of 71 ml in FVC and 60 ml in FEV1 and neither measure declined through age 38. In contrast, participants with baseline BMI ≥ 26.4 kg/m2 experienced 10 year decreases of 185 ml in FVC and 64 ml in FEV1. FEV1/FVC increased with increasing BMI. Weight gain was also associated with lung function. Those who gained the most weight over 10 years had the largest decrease in FVC, but FVC increased with weight gain in those initially thinnest. In contrast, FEV1 decreased with increasing weight gain in all participants, with maximum decline in obese individuals who gained the most weight during the study.

Conclusion
Among healthy young adults, increasing BMI in the initially thin participants was associated with increasing then stable lung function through age 38, but there were substantial lung function losses with higher and increasing fatness. These results suggest that the obesity epidemic threatens the lung health of the general population.},

METHODS: Using a longitudinal design 1221 Chilean young adults were studied. A standardized respiratory questionnaire was used. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)), forced vital capacity (FVC), height, weight and waist circumference were measured. Data at birth and at 1 year were obtained from clinical notes.
RESULTS: Males with a BMI {\textgreater} or = 30 and women with a BMI {\textless} 20 had a lower FEV(1) (-230 mL, 95\% CI -363 to -98; -106 mL, 95\% CI -211 to -0.18, respectively). In both sexes those with a BMI 20-25 had the highest FEV(1) and FVC. In males there was a negative association between waist circumference and FEV(1) and FVC while in women the middle tertile had the highest FEV(1) and FVC. There was an association between birthweight and BMI at birth, and FEV(1) in men, when unadjusted for other measurements.
CONCLUSIONS: BMI and waist circumference in adulthood make a greater impact on lung function in adulthood than anthropometric measurements at birth and infancy. Proxy measures of fatness in adulthood reduce lung function, but the pattern between fatness and lung function by sex may be different.},

	abstract = {Personalised medicine aims to tailor medical decisions to the individual patient. A possible approach is to stratify patients according to the risk of adverse outcomes such as exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Risk-stratified approaches are particularly attractive for drugs like inhaled corticosteroids or phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors that reduce exacerbations but are associated with harms. However, it is currently not clear which models are best to predict exacerbations in patients with COPD. Therefore, our aim was to identify and critically appraise studies on models that predict exacerbations in COPD patients. Out of 1382 studies, 25 studies with 27 prediction models were included. The prediction models showed great heterogeneity in terms of number and type of predictors, time horizon, statistical methods and measures of prediction model performance. Only two out of 25 studies validated the developed model, and only one out of 27 models provided estimates of individual exacerbation risk, only three out of 27 prediction models used high-quality statistical approaches for model development and evaluation. Overall, none of the existing models fulfilled the requirements for risk-stratified treatment to personalise COPD care. A more harmonised approach to develop and validate high- quality prediction models is needed to move personalised COPD medicine forward.
None of the 27 prediction models for COPD exacerbations appears to be ready to support personalised COPD treatment http://ow.ly/Lq2b302IWRx},

	abstract = {Multiple outcomes, both continuous and discrete, are routinely gathered on subjects in longitudinal studies and during routine clinical follow-up in general. To motivate our work, we consider a longitudinal study on patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with a continuous bilirubin level, a discrete platelet count and a dichotomous indication of blood vessel malformations as examples of such longitudinal outcomes. An apparent requirement is to use all the outcome values to classify the subjects into groups (e.g., groups of subjects with a similar prognosis in a clinical setting). In recent years, numerous approaches have been suggested for classification based on longitudinal (or otherwise correlated) outcomes, targeting not only traditional areas like biostatistics, but also rapidly evolving bioinformatics and many others. However, most available approaches consider only continuous outcomes as a basis for classification, or if noncontinuous outcomes are considered, then not in combination with other outcomes of a different nature. Here, we propose a statistical method for clustering (classification) of subjects into a prespecified number of groups with a priori unknown characteristics on the basis of repeated measurements of several longitudinal outcomes of a different nature. This method relies on a multivariate extension of the classical generalized linear mixed model where a mixture distribution is additionally assumed for random effects. We base the inference on a Bayesian specification of the model and simulation-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology. To apply the method in practice, we have prepared ready-to-use software for use in R (http://www.R-project.org). We also discuss evaluation of uncertainty in the classification and also discuss usage of a recently proposed methodology for model comparison—the selection of a number of clusters in our case—based on the penalized posterior deviance proposed by Plummer [Biostatistics 9 (2008) 523–539].},

Caucasian subjects had higher mean FVC and FEV1 values than did Mexican-American and African-American subjects across the entire age range. However, Caucasian and Mexican-American subjects had similar FVC and FEV1 values with respect to height, and African-American subjects had lower values. These differences may be partially due to differences in body build: observed Mexican-Americans were shorter than Caucasian subjects of the same age, and African-Americans on average have a smaller trunk:leg ratio than do Caucasians. Reference values and lower limits of normal were derived using a piecewise polynomial model with age and height as predictors.

	abstract = {Motivation: Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput technology is often facing the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable types. We propose a non-parametric method which can cope with different types of variables simultaneously.Results: We compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random forest, we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values ranging from 10\% to 30\%. We show that missForest can successfully handle missing values, particularly in datasets including different types of variables. In our comparative study, missForest outperforms other methods of imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and non-linear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional data.Availability: The ℝ package missForest is freely available from http://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/.Contact:stekhoven@stat.math.ethz.ch; buhlmann@stat.math.ethz.ch},

	abstract = {Background
Evidence suggests that common complex diseases may be partially due to SNP-SNP interactions, but such detection is yet to be fully established in a high-dimensional small-sample (small-n-large-p) study. A number of penalized regression techniques are gaining popularity within the statistical community, and are now being applied to detect interactions. These techniques tend to be over-fitting, and are prone to false positives. The recently developed stability least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (SLASSO) has been used to control family-wise error rate, but often at the expense of power (and thus false negative results).

Results
Here, we propose an alternative stability selection procedure known as stability smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SSCAD). Briefly, this method applies a smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) algorithm to multiple sub-samples, and then identifies cluster ensemble of interactions across the sub-samples. The proposed method was compared with SLASSO and two kinds of traditional penalized methods by intensive simulation. The simulation revealed higher power and lower false discovery rate (FDR) with SSCAD. An analysis using the new method on the previously published GWAS of lung cancer confirmed all significant interactions identified with SLASSO, and identified two additional interactions not reported with SLASSO analysis.

Conclusions
Based on the results obtained in this study, SSCAD presents to be a powerful procedure for the detection of SNP-SNP interactions in large-scale genomic data.},

METHODS: Medication errors were defined by using widely accepted criteria. Rates of prescription, transcription, administration, and dispensing errors were determined, and the risk of harm from each error was rated as high, moderate, or low. A review team was assigned to retrospectively review 31 patient records for prescription, transcription, and administration errors for a total of 1,448 patient-days. Dispensing errors, which can only be determined concurrently, were reported for an equivalent number of patient-days. The error rate was compared with the rate that was determined by the usual method of self-reports from all nursing and medical staff.
RESULTS: In the 31 charts retrospectively reviewed and the dispensing events concurrently reviewed, the team detected a total of 2,194 medication errors, whereas a total of nine errors were self-reported for the same patient group. Administration errors accounted for more than half of the total (66 percent), followed by transcription errors (23 percent), prescription errors (11 percent), and dispensing errors (less than 1 percent). Nineteen percent of errors were rated as having a low risk of harm, 23 percent as having a moderate risk, and 58 percent as having a high risk.

METHODS: Medication errors were defined by using widely accepted criteria. Rates of prescription, transcription, administration, and dispensing errors were determined, and the risk of harm from each error was rated as high, moderate, or low. A review team was assigned to retrospectively review 31 patient records for prescription, transcription, and administration errors for a total of 1,448 patient-days. Dispensing errors, which can only be determined concurrently, were reported for an equivalent number of patient-days. The error rate was compared with the rate that was determined by the usual method of self-reports from all nursing and medical staff.
RESULTS: In the 31 charts retrospectively reviewed and the dispensing events concurrently reviewed, the team detected a total of 2,194 medication errors, whereas a total of nine errors were self-reported for the same patient group. Administration errors accounted for more than half of the total (66 percent), followed by transcription errors (23 percent), prescription errors (11 percent), and dispensing errors (less than 1 percent). Nineteen percent of errors were rated as having a low risk of harm, 23 percent as having a moderate risk, and 58 percent as having a high risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of a review team should be considered as a method for detecting and reporting medication errors.},

	abstract = {Inhaled β2-adrenoceptor agonists (β2-agonists) are the most commonly used asthma medications in many Western countries. Minor adverse effects such as palpitations, tremor, headache and metabolic effects are predictable and dose related. Time series studies suggested an association between the relatively nonselective β-agonist fenoterol and asthma deaths. Three case-control studies confirmed that among patients prescribed fenoterol, the risk of death was significantly elevated even after controlling for the severity of asthma. The Saskatchewan study not only found an increased risk of death among patients dispensed fenoterol, but also suggested this might be a class effect of β2-agonists. However, in subsequent studies, the long-acting β2-agonist salmeterol was not associated with increased asthma mortality. In a case-control study blood albuterol (salbutamol) concentrations were found to be 2.5 times higher among patients who died of asthma compared with controls. It is speculated that such toxic concentrations could cause tachyarrhythmias under conditions of hypoxia and hypokalemia.The risk of asthma exacerbations and near-fatal attacks may also be increased among patients dispensed fenoterol, but this association may be largely due to confounding by severity. Although salmeterol does not appear to increase the risk of near-fatal attacks, there is a consistent association with the use of nebulized β2-agonists. Nebulized and oral β2-agonists are also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death, ischemic heart disease and cardiac failure. Caution should be exercised when first prescribing a β-agonist for patients with cardiovascular disease.A potential mechanism for adverse effects with regular use of β2-agonists is tachyphylaxis. Tachyphylaxis to the bronchodilator effects of long-acting β2-agonists can occur, but has been consistently demonstrated only for formoterol (eformoterol) a full agonist, rather than salmeterol, a partial agonist. Tachyphylaxis to protection against induced bronchospasm occurs with both full and partial β2-agonists, and probably within a matter of days at most. Underlying airway responsiveness to directly acting bronchoconstricting agents is not increased when the bronchodilator effect of the regular β2-agonist has been allowed to wear off, although there may be an increase in responsiveness to indirectly acting agents. While there has been speculation that underlying airway inflammation in asthma may be made worse by regular use of short-acting β2-agonists, in contradistinction, a number of studies have shown that long-acting β2-agonists have positive anti-inflammatory effects.An Australian Cochrane Airways Group systematic review of the randomized, controlled trials of short-acting β-agonists found only minimal and clinically unimportant differences between regular use and use as needed. Regular short-acting treatment was better than placebo. However, a subsequent systematic review has found that regular use of long-acting β-agonists had significant advantages over regular use of short-acting β-agonists. More studies and data are needed on the regular use of β2-agonists in patients not taking inhaled corticosteroids, and in potentially vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and those with particular genotypes for the β-receptor, who might be more prone to adverse effects.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.05.008},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: According to current asthma treatment guidelines, single-entity inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) should be used as initial controller therapy in children with mild to moderate persistent asthma. Long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABAs) can be added to therapy for those patients whose asthma is not well controlled with a single-entity ICS.
OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to examine whether the claims history for children in a US insured population indicate proper fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol (FPS) fixed-dose combination use in accordance with recommended asthma guidelines and a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory and black box warning regarding LABA use. A comparison of study-drug charges was also conducted.
METHODS: Data from a US commercial insurance database were used in this retrospective study to evaluate pharmacy and medical claims for children between October 2004 and September 2006 (ie, the index period). An index date corresponding to the date of the first FPS claim was assigned to each patient. Eligible patients were aged 4 to 11 years and had {\textgreater}/=1 pharmacy claim for FPS during the index period. Those patients receiving 1 FPS prescription dose strength on the index date who were continuously enrolled for benefits during the preindex period (ie, the 365 days before the index date) were included in the study. Disease severity was assigned based on asthma-related pharmacy (frequency and/or incidence of oral corticosteroid, LABA, montelukast, and {\textgreater}365 doses of a short-acting beta(2)-agonist) and medical (asthma-related urgent care clinic or emergency department visits or hospitalizations) claim histories during the preindex period.
RESULTS: A total of 13,306 patients between the ages of 4 and 11 years on the index date were included in the study; their mean (SD) age was 8.9 (1.9) years. The majority of the patients were male (60.7\%). Of the total FPS claims, 55.2\% were for patients with no evidence of pharmacy or medical claims in the 365 days before the first FPS claim that would warrant ICS/LABA combination therapy according to asthma treatment guidelines. There were no large changes in preindex ICS claims over the course of the study in response to an FDA-issued advisory and black box warning regarding the use of LABAs. Median drug charges for single-entity ICS use were \$98 compared with \$168 for FPS therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: ICS/LABA combination treatment was used as initial therapy in 55.2\% of children with mild to moderate asthma in this claims database population, contrary to the recommendations of current asthma treatment guidelines. The FDA advisory and black box warning for LABA use had little observed impact on the number of single-entity ICS claims.},

OBJECTIVES: To describe the use of combination therapy for the treatment of asthma and to evaluate to which extent it is prescribed as recommended.
METHODS: A cohort of 14559 new users of a combination therapy identified between January 1, 2000 and September 30, 2003 was selected from beneficiaries of the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec. We evaluated whether the combination therapy was prescribed according to the Canadian Asthma Guidelines. A logistic regression analysis was also performed to identify patient's and physician's characteristics associated with the adherence to the recommendations of the Canadian Asthma Guidelines for the prescription of a combination therapy.
RESULTS: Only 40\% of users of combination therapy filled a prescription of ICS in the year preceding the initiation of the therapy and this proportion decreased by 21.8\% from 2000 to 2003. Patients who received their first combination therapy in an emergency department were less likely to have used ICS previously, but patients treated by a respiratory physician and patients with co-morbidities, markers of asthma severity and markers of uncontrolled asthma were more likely to have used ICS previously.
CONCLUSION: Combination therapy has not been used according to the Canadian Asthma Guidelines in a large proportion of patients.},

This study aims to examine how inhaled asthma medications are used in the US and to examine whether inappropriate use of inhaled SABs is associated with poor patient health.Research design and methods: The study design was a retrospective analysis of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) for asthmatic patients 5 years or older who had used SAB medication during the period from 1996 through 2000. Use of SAB medication was defined as inappropriate when a patient inhaled more than 225 defined daily doses (DDDs) of SABs but less than 45.625 DDDs of corticosteroids per year. Health status was evaluated using survey respondents’ perceptions on a 5‐point Likert scale. Five functional limitations (activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, walking, social function, and cognitive function) were rated on a dichotomous scale.Results: A total of 2386 asthmatic patients were identified as having used a SAB in the period 1996 through 2000. Of these, 272 (11.4\%) used excessive doses of SABs, and of this group of excessive users, 151 (55.5\%) underused corticosteroids. Compared to appropriate users of SAB medication, inappropriate users had lower perceptions of their overall health (adjusted mean: 3.21 vs. 2.94, p {\textless} 0.05) and mental health (adjusted mean: 2.39 vs. 2.13, p {\textless} 0.05). They were also at an increased risk of limitations in walking (relative risk [RR]: 1.76, 95\% confidence interval [CI]:1.15–2.71) and in cognitive function (RR: 2.32, 95\% CI: 1.37–3.93).Conclusion: Despite the national guidelines concerning the proper use of inhaled asthma medication, over-reliance on SAB medication and under-use of corticosteroids persists in the US. Those not using asthma medication according to the guidelines had poor perceptions of their health and were subject to an increased risk of limitations in walking and cognitive function.},

METHODS: We used population-based administrative health data from British Columbia (BC), Canada, to create a cohort of asthma patients aged 14 to 55. The exposure of interest was inappropriate use of SABA with any given 12-month period, as defined and validated previously. The primary outcome was asthma-related hospitalization in the following three-month period; secondary outcomes were asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits, asthma-related intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and asthma-attributable costs.
RESULTS: A total of 343,520 individuals contributed 2,127,592 patient-years of follow up. Of these, in 190,546 patient-years (7.7\%) SABAs were used inappropriately. Inappropriate use of SABAs in any given year was associated with a 45\% (odds ratio (OR) = 1.45, 95\%CI 1.26-1.66) increase in the risk of asthma-related admissions in the following three-month period. Similarly, inappropriate use of SABA was associated with 25\% (OR = 1.25, 95\% CI 1.18-1.33) increase in the risk of asthma-related ED visits. The association with ICU admissions was not statistically significant. Inappropriate use of SABA was associated with a 6\% (relative rate [RR] = 1.06, 95\% CI = 1.04-1.08) increase in total-asthma-related costs.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The importance of balance between controller and reliever medications in asthma is recognized. However, to our knowledge, the extent to which real-world practice has caught up with evidence-based guidelines has not been studied.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of individuals 15 to 67 years of age who satisfied a validated case definition of asthma in the administrative health database of British Columbia, Canada between 2002 and 2013. Each patient-year was assessed for inappropriate and excessive prescription of short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) and the balance between controller and reliever medications. Trends on three time axes were evaluated: calendar time, time course of asthma, and age. Poisson regression was used to test for a linear trend.
RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-six thousand, one hundred twelve patients (56.5\% female sex; mean age, 30.5 years) contributed 2.6 million patient-years. In 7.3\% of the patient-years, SABAs were prescribed inappropriately. This proportion dropped by a relative rate of 5.3\% per year (P {\textless} .001). In the first year of asthma, 6.3\% of patients had indicators of inappropriate SABA use, which dropped within the first 3 years but increased thereafter. Excessive prescription of SABAs increased rapidly during the time course of asthma (change of 23.3\% per year; P {\textless} .001) and by age (change of 5.1\% per year; P {\textless} .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite overwhelming evidence regarding the risks, inappropriate prescription for SABAs was prevalent. Excessive SABA use might explain high asthma mortality in older patients. Inappropriate prescriptions declined over the study period but increased over the time course of asthma. These trends might have contributed to the declining asthma hospitalization rates in British Columbia, but there remain gaps in care and potential for improvement in asthma outcomes.},

In the first general population based study to apply post-bronchodilator values, the prevalence and predictors of GOLD defined COPD were assessed and the implications of ß2 agonist reversibility testing examined. , Methods: Based on a random population sample, 2235 subjects (77\%) aged 26–82 years performed spirometric tests before and 15 minutes after inhaling 0.3 mg salbutamol. , Results: The prevalence of GOLD defined COPD was 7.0\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 5.9 to 8.0). This estimate was 27\% lower than COPD defined without bronchodilatation. One percent of the population had severe or very severe COPD. Compared with women, men had 3.1 (95\% CI 2.1 to 4.8) times higher odds for COPD. Subjects with a smoking history of more than 20 pack years had an odds ratio (OR) of 6.2 (95\% CI 3.4 to 11.0) for COPD relative to never-smokers, while subjects older than 75 years had an OR of 18.0 (95\% CI 9.2 to 35.0) relative to those below 45 years. Subjects with primary education only had an OR of 2.8 (95\% CI 1.4 to 5.3) compared with those with university education. Subjects with body mass index (BMI) {\textless}20 kg/m2 were more likely than subjects with BMI 25–29.9 kg/m2 to have COPD (OR 2.4, 95\% CI 1.1 to 5.3). The adjusted proportion of COPD attributable to smoking was 68\%. , Conclusions: These results indicate that community programmes on prevention of COPD should focus on anti-smoking, nutritional aspects, and socioeconomic conditions.

METHODS: This study was based on 11,623 adult participants of NHANES III (1988-1994; median age 41.0). Serum lipids and blood pressure were measured during the NHANES III examination. Average exposure for 1988-1994 to particulate matter {\textless}10 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) at the residences of participants was estimated based on measurements from US Environmental Protection Agency monitors. Multivariate linear regression was used to estimate the associations of PM10 with lipids and blood pressure.
RESULTS: An interquartile range width increase in PM10 exposure (11.1 μg/m) in the study population was associated with 2.42\% greater serum triglycerides (95\% confidence interval: 1.09, 3.76); multivariate adjusted means of triglycerides according to increasing quartiles of PM10 were 137.6, 142.5, 142.6, and 148.9 mg/dl, respectively. An interquartile range width increase in PM10 was associated with 1.43\% greater total cholesterol (95\% confidence interval: 1.21, 1.66). These relationships with triglycerides and total cholesterol did not differ by age or region. Associations of PM10 with blood pressure were modest.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this large, diverse study indicate that greater long-term PM10 exposure is associated with elevated serum triglycerides and total cholesterol, potentially mediating air pollution-related effects on CVD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vital Capacity (VC) is defined as a change in volume of lung after maximal inspiration followed by maximal expiration is called Vital Capacity of lungs. It is the sum of tidal volume, inspiratory reserve volume .and expiratory reserve volume. Vital capacity of normal adults ranges between 3 to 5 litres. A number of physiological factors like age, gender, height and ethnicity effect lung volumes. The reference values of lung volume and capacities were calculated previously and those studies played pivotal role in establishing the fact that air volume capacities measured in an individual fall within a wide range among healthy persons of same age, gender and height buit with different ethnicity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in vital capacity in with height and gender.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 74 male students in the Department of Physiology, Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences, Jamshoro during January-March, 2014. The volunteers were divided into 2 groups of height ≤ 167.4 cm and {\textgreater} 167.4 cm. The volunteers' height was measured in cm. Vital capacity of the subjects was measured using standard protocol. Mean ± SD of age, height and vital capacity were calculated.
RESULTS: Mean vital capacity in students with height {\textgreater} 167.4 cm was higher than average vital capacity of students with height ≤ 167.4 cm. It might be due to the increased surface area of the lungs in relation with increasing height.
CONCLUSIONS: There are variations in vital capacity of individuals in relation to their heights, within the same ethnic and age groups.},

	volume = {21},
	issn = {0735-0414},
	abstract = {The existence of racial differences in alcohol sensitivity between Oriental and Caucasian populations has been well documented. The primary manifestation is a highly visible facial flushing (47-85\% in Orientals vs 3-29\% in Caucasians) accompanied by other objective and subjective symptoms of discomfort. Even among different Oriental groups, subtle differences in the flushing response and alcohol consumption can exist. North and South American Indian populations differ in phenotypes for alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, but systematic studies comparing degree of flushing, alcohol elimination rates and blood acetaldehyde levels in these populations are lacking. Although flushing does not automatically 'immunize' an individual against alcohol use, those susceptible tend to consume less alcohol, at least in Orientals. However, the flushing phenomenon cannot be the sole explanation for differences in incidences of alcoholism among different racial groups. Socio-cultural, environmental and genetic factors also have to be considered. An increased incidence of flushing has been found to associate with a familial risk of development of future alcoholism in a Caucasian population. It remains to be determined whether the same is true in Orientals. Most biochemical investigations of the flushing phenomenon have focused on aspects of alcohol metabolism. Based on recent findings, a convincing mechanism is the higher accumulation of acetaldehyde in flushing subjects because they have an unusual, less-active liver aldehyde dehydrogenase isozyme (ALDHI). The possibility that an 'atypical' alcohol dehydrogenase, which is present in 85-90\% of Oriental subjects, can contribute to increased blood acetaldehyde levels in flushing subjects cannot be ruled out. Based on results of a small number of pedigree studies which demonstrated familial resemblances in flushing, a pharmacogenetic defect in ALDHI has been proposed to be responsible for flushing. Other possible biochemical mechanisms (e.g. prostaglandins) and genetic defects need to be investigated.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Limited data suggest that moderate alcohol drinkers may have better lung airways function than abstainers. Because few studies have fully accounted for confounders (including smoking and coronary disease), and some might have been biased by the inclusion with nondrinkers of alcohol drinkers who quit because of illness, we performed a cross-sectional analysis in a large free-living population.
METHODS: We studied the relation between alcohol and airways function in 177,721 members of a comprehensive health plan. An item on a questionnaire administered as part of a health examination asked for "usual number of drinks in the past year." Respondents were asked to lump "wine, beer, whiskey, and cocktails" together. Health history queries included 47 items indicative of possible cardiorespiratory (CR) illness; participants with one or more positive response (61.0\%) were classified as "CR yes." Lung function measurements were part of the health examination; we studied one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV(1)), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV(1)/FVC by analysis of covariance and FEV(1)/FVC {\textless}0.7 by logistic regression. Nondrinkers were the referent for alcohol categories; covariates were age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, education, body mass index, and CR composite yes/no.
RESULTS: For each measure studied, persons reporting two or fewer drinks per day or three to five drinks per day had better airways function than nondrinkers (p {\textless} 0.001), but heavier drinkers had worse function. This J-shaped relation was consistent across multiple strata, including CR "yes" or "no."
CONCLUSION: Independent of smoking and evident lung or heart disease, light to moderate drinkers of alcohol had better FEV(1), FVC, and FEV(1)/FVC than abstainers did. Although this association does not prove causality, drinking moderate amounts of alcoholic beverages may have some benefit for lung function.},

DESIGN: A random-effects metaregression analysis to synthesize results from common cross-sectional regression models fit to participants in each of 10 gender-race strata in each of eight large population-based observational studies or clinical trials.
SETTING: Source data collected as part of the most recently completed examination cycle for each of the participating studies.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants ranged in age from 30 to 85 years, although the age, race, gender, and general health characteristics of each of the populations varied greatly.
INTERVENTIONS: Most of the studies were observational in nature, although some did involve lifestyle interventions. All treatment assignments were ignored in the analysis.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: All studies measured lung function using standardized methods with centrally trained and certified technicians. Study findings confirm statistically significant, dose-related smoking effects in all race-gender groups studied. Significant gender differences in the effects of cigarette smoking were seen only for blacks; black men who smoked had greater smoking-related declines in FEV(1) than did black women. This effect was present in only one of two smoking models, however. Significant racial differences in the effects of smoking were seen only for men, with Asian/Pacific Islanders having smaller smoking-related declines than white men in both models.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this analysis generally failed to support the hypothesis of widespread differences in the effects of cigarette smoking on lung function between gender or racial subgroups.},

	abstract = {Summary
Studies on the influence of alcohol consumption on lung function have shown conflicting results. Self-reported alcohol consumption may be inaccurate. This study used both a validated alcohol questionnaire and a blood marker of heavy alcohol consumption, and examined potential associations with different lung physiological variables. The study population (450 subjects) answered an alcohol questionnaire (AUDIT-C) and performed spirometry, body plethysmography and a test for diffusing capacity for CO (DL,CO). Carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT), a clinically used blood marker for identifying heavy alcohol consumption, and C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation were analysed. Using AUDIT-C, 407 subjects were alcohol drinkers and 29 non-drinkers. Of the alcohol drinkers, 224 subjects were “hazardous drinkers” and 183 “moderate drinkers”. Thirty-four subjects had a CDT ≥2.0\% (=heavy drinkers). There was no difference in lung function between hazardous and moderate drinkers. Heavy drinkers had lower DL,CO (74\% vs 83\% PN, p = 0.003), more symptoms of chronic bronchitis (p = 0.001) and higher AUDIT-C scores (p {\textless} 0.001) than non-heavy drinkers. After adjustments (pack years and CRP) the difference in DL,CO (p = 0.037) remained. Multiple regression showed an association between CDT and both FEV1 (p = 0.004) and DL,CO (p = 0.012) in all alcohol drinkers, but not in never-smokers. The AUDIT-C score was associated with CDT (also after adjustments, p {\textless} 0.001) but not with any lung function variable. The results from this study suggest that alcohol and particularly heavy drinking has an independent additive negative effect on lung function in smokers.},

	abstract = {The volatility of alcohol promotes the movement of alcohol from the bronchial circulation across the airway epithelium and into the conducting airways of the lung. The exposure of the airways through this route likely accounts for many of the biologic effects of alcohol on lung airway functions. The impact of alcohol on lung airway functions is dependent on the concentration, duration and route of exposure. Brief exposure to mild concentrations of alcohol may enhance mucociliary clearance, stimulates bronchodilation and probably attenuates the airway inflammation and injury observed in asthma and COPD. Prolonged and heavy exposure to alcohol impairs mucociliary clearance, may complicate asthma management and likely worsens outcomes including lung function and mortality in COPD patients. Non-alcohol congeners and alcohol metabolites act as triggers for airway disease exacerbations especially in atopic asthmatics and in Asian populations who have a reduced capacity to metabolize alcohol. Research focused on the mechanisms of alcohol-mediated changes in airway functions has identified specific mechanisms that mediate alcohol effects within the lung airways. These include prominent roles for the second messengers calcium and nitric oxide, regulatory kinases including PKG and PKA, alcohol and acetaldehyde-metabolizing enzymes such as aldehyde dehydrogenase type 2 (ALDH2). The role alcohol may play in the pathobiology of airway mucus, bronchial blood flow, airway smooth muscle regulation and the interaction with other airway exposure agents, such as cigarette smoke, represent opportunities for future investigation.},

We attempted to determine causal relationships between smoking and elevated WBC count by retrospective cross-sectional study consisting of 37,972 healthy Japanese adults who had a health check-up between April 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009 and longitudinal study involving 1730 current smokers who had more than four consecutive annual health check-ups between April 1, 2007 and March 31, 2012., In the cross-sectional study, younger age, male gender, increased body mass index, no alcohol habit, current smoking, and elevated C-reactive protein level were associated with elevated WBC count. Among these factors, current smoking had the most significant association with elevated WBC count. In subgroup analyses by WBC differentials, smoking was significantly associated with elevated counts of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Ex-smoking was not associated with elevated WBC count. In the longitudinal study, both WBC and neutrophil counts decreased significantly in one year after smoking cessation and remained down-regulated for longer than next two years. There was no significant change in either WBC or neutrophil count in those who continued smoking., These findings clearly demonstrated that current smoking is strongly associated with elevated WBC count and smoking cessation leads to recovery of WBC count in one year, which is maintained for longer than subsequent two years. Thus, current smoking is a significant and reversible cause of elevated WBC count in healthy adults.,

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A variety of inflammatory disorders influence the serum white blood cell (WBC) count. Elevated systemic inflammatory insult may contribute to impaired lung function, such as obstructive or restrictive lung disease. The aim of our study is to investigate the correlation between WBC count and pulmonary function.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eligible participants aged ≥ 18 years (n = 16 312) were enrolled from the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, 1988-1994. Pertinent information including pulmonary function test, demographics, WBC count, glucose, C-reactive protein and a personal health questionnaire were obtained for subjects without known pulmonary diseases. White blood cell counts were classified into quartiles over the normal range. Multiple hierarchical regression models and trends testing were used to assess the correlation between WBC counts and pulmonary function tests.
RESULTS: In the unadjusted mode of quartile-based analysis, the beta coefficients interpreted as the differences in FEV1\% predicted upon comparing subjects in the upper three quartiles of WBC count to those in the lowest quartile were - 0.007, - 0.022 and - 0.041 (P {\textless} 0.001). After adjusting for multiple pertinent covariates, inverse association between quartiles of WBC count and FEV1\% predicted remained essentially unchanged. The negative trends between FEV1\% predicted and WBC count quartiles in the stratified comparison with extended-model approach were statistically significant (P for trends {\textless} 0.001) in quartile-based multiple linear regression.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated WBC count is independently associated with declined pulmonary function. It may be a simple, accessible and inexpensive indicator of changes in pulmonary function.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anemia, a highly prevalent disorder in elderly populations, is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, including increased mortality, impaired functional status and cognitive disorders. Approximately two-thirds of anemia in American elderly is caused by chronic inflammation or is unexplained. A potential contributing factor may include air pollution exposures, which have been shown to increase systemic inflammation and affect erythropoiesis. Few studies, however, have investigated the associations of air pollution on hemoglobin levels and anemia.
METHODS: We used linear regression models and modified Poisson regression with robust error variance to examine the associations of particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on hemoglobin concentrations and prevalence of anemia, respectively, among 4121 older Americans enrolled in the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project. We estimated participant-specific exposures to PM2.5 using spatio-temporal models, and to NO2 using nearest measurements from Environmental Protection Agency's Air Quality System. Hemoglobin levels were measured for participants in each of two data collection waves from dried blood spots. Anemia was defined using World Health Organization hemoglobin-based criteria of {\textless}13 and {\textless}12g/dL for men and women, respectively. Models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, race, income, education, neighborhood socioeconomic status, region, urbanicity and medication use. Mediation by C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation, was also investigated.
RESULTS: An inter-quartile range (IQR, 3.9μg/m3) increase in the one-year moving average PM2.5 was positively associated with anemia prevalence (prevalence ratio, or PR 1.33, 95\% CI: 1.23, 1.45) and decreases in average hemoglobin of 0.81g/dL (p{\textless}0.001). Similarly, an IQR (9.6ppb) increase in NO2 was associated with anemia prevalence (PR 1.43, 95\% CI: 1.25, 1.63) and a decrease in average hemoglobin of 0.81g/dL (p{\textless}0.001). Strong dose-response relationships were identified for both pollutants. Mediation of the effect of PM2.5 by CRP was also identified (p=0.007).
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATIONS: Air pollution exposures were significantly associated with increased prevalence of anemia and decreased hemoglobin levels in a cohort of older Americans. If causal, these associations could indicate that chronic air pollution exposure is an important risk factor for anemia in older adults.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) is considered a trigger for acute cardiovascular events. Diesel Exhaust (DE) is a major contributor to TRAP in the world. We evaluated the effect of DE inhalation on circulating blood cell populations, hematological indices, and systemic inflammatory cytokines in humans using a specialized facility.
METHODS: In a randomized double-blind crossover study balanced to order, 17 metabolic syndrome (MetS) and 15 healthy subjects inhaled filtered air (FA) or DE exposure in two-hour sessions on different days with a minimum 2-week washout period. We collected blood pre-exposure, 7, and 22 hours after exposure initiation and measured the complete blood count and differential. We performed multiplex cytokine assay to measure the changes in the systemic inflammatory cytokines, and endothelial adhesion molecules (n=15). A paired analysis compared the effect of DE and FA exposures for the change from pre-exposure to the subsequent time points.
RESULTS: A significant increase in the hematocrit was noted 7 hrs after DE [1.4\% (95\% CI: 0.9 to 1.9\%)] compared to FA exposure [0.5\% (95\% CI: -0.09 to 1.0\%); p=0.008. The hemoglobin levels increased non-significantly at 7 hrs post DE [0.3 gm/dL (95\% CI: 0.2 to 0.5 gm/dL)] versus FA exposure [0.2 gm/dL (95\% CI: 0 to 0.3 gm/dL)]; p=0.06. Furthermore, the platelet count increased 22 hrs after DE exposure in healthy, but not in MetS subjects [DE: 16.6 (95\% CI: 10.2 to 23) thousand platelets/mL versus [FA: 3.4 (95\% CI: -9.5 to 16.3) thousand platelets/mL)]; p=0.04. No DE effect was observed for WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes or erythrocytes. Using the multiplex assay, small borderline significant increases in matrix metalloproteinase-9, interleukins (IL)-1 beta, 6 and 10 occurred 7 hrs post exposure initiation, whereas E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule -1, and myeloperoxidase 22 hrs post exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that short-term DE exposure results in hemoconcentration and thrombocytosis, which are important determinants of acute cardiovascular events. Multiplex assay showed a non-significant increase in IL-1β and IL-6 immediately post exposure followed by myeloperoxidase and endothelial activation molecules. Further specific assays in a larger population will improve our understanding of the systemic inflammatory mechanisms following acute exposure to TRAP.},

	abstract = {Objective:
Tobacco cigarette smoking is one of the major leading causes of death throughout the world. Smoking has both acute and chronic effect on haematological parameters. The aim of the present study was to assess the extent of adverse effects of cigarette smoking on biochemical characteristics in healthy smokers.

Subjects and Method:
One hundred and fifty six subjects participated in this study, 56 smokers and 100 non-smokers. The smokers were regularly consuming 10-20 cigarettes per day for at least 3 years. Complete blood cell count was analyzed by CELL-DYN 3700 fully automatic haematological analyzer.

Results:
The smokers had significantly higher levels of white blood cell (p{\textless}0,001), hemoglobin (p=0,042), mean corpuscular volume (p=0,001) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (p{\textless}0,001). All other measured parameters did not differ significantly. Cigarette smoking caused a significant increase (p{\textless}0,001) in red blood cells, white blood cells (p=0,040), hemoglobin (p{\textless}0,001), hematocrit (p=0,047) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (p{\textless}0,001) in males in comparison to female smokers.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, our study showed that continuous cigarette smoking has severe adverse effects on haematological parameters (e.g., hemoglobin, white blood cells count, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red blood cells count, hematocrit) and these alterations might be associated with a greater risk for developing atherosclerosis, polycythemia vera, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or cardiovascular diseases.},

	abstract = {Objective This study intended to search for potential correlations between anaemia in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; GOLD stage III) and pulmonary function at rest, exercise capacity as well as ventilatory efficiency, using pulmonary function test (PFT) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).
Setting The study was undertaken at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, a tertiary-level centre affiliated to Tongji University. It caters to a large population base within Shanghai and referrals from centres in other cities as well.
Participants 157 Chinese patients with stable severe COPD were divided into 2 groups: the anaemia group (haemoglobin (Hb) {\textless}12.0 g/dL for males, and {\textless}11 g/dL for females (n=48)) and the non-anaemia group (n=109).
Primary and secondary outcome measures Arterial blood gas, PFT and CPET were tested in all patients.
Results (1) Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) corrected by Hb was significantly lower in the anaemia group ((15.3±1.9) mL/min/mm Hg) than in the non-anaemia group ((17.1±2.1) mL/min/mm Hg) (p{\textless}0.05). A significant difference did not exist in the level of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1\%pred, FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC), inspiratory capacity (IC), residual volume (RV), total lung capacity (TLC) and RV/TLC (p{\textgreater}0.05). (2) Peak Load, Peak oxygen uptake (), Peak \%pred, Peak , Peak pulse and the ratio of increase to WR increase () were significantly lower in the anaemia group (p{\textless}0.05); however, Peak minute ventilation (VE), Lowest /carbon dioxide output () and Peak dead space/tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) were similar between the 2 groups (p{\textgreater}0.05). (3) A strong positive correlation was found between Hb concentration and Peak in patients with anaemia (r=0.702, p{\textless}0.01).
Conclusions Anaemia has a negative impact on gas exchange and exercise tolerance during exercise in patients with severe COPD. The decrease in amplitude of Hb levels is related to the quantity of oxygen uptake.},

We therefore set out to establish how changes of the Hct level in the pulmonary circulation affect the airway and lung tissue viscoelastic properties. The Hct level of the blood in an isolated perfused rat lung model was randomly altered. Intermediate (26.5\%), followed by low (6.6\%) or normal (43.7\%), Hct was set in two consecutive sequences. The pulmonary capillary pressure was maintained constant throughout the experiment, and the pulmonary hemodynamic parameters were monitored continuously. The airway resistance (Raw), the viscous (G) and elastic (H) parameters, and the hysteresivity (η = G/H) of the lung tissues were obtained from measurements of forced oscillatory input impedance data. Raw was not affected by the alterations of the Hct levels. As concerns the lung tissues, the decrease of Hct to intermediate or low levels resulted in close to proportional decreases in the viscoelastic parameters G [16.5 ± 7.7\% (SD), 12.1 ± 9.5\%, P {\textless} 0.005] and H (13.2 ± 8.6\%, 10.8 ± 4.7\%, P {\textless} 0.001). No significant changes in η were detected in a wide range of Hct, which indicates that coupled processes cause alterations in the resistive and elastic properties of the lungs following Hct changes in the pulmonary circulation. The diminishment of the viscous and elastic parameters of the pulmonary parenchyma following a reduction of blood Hct demonstrates the significant contribution of the red blood cells to the overall lung viscoelasticity.},

Variable selection plays a pivotal role in contemporary statistical learning and scientific discoveries. The traditional idea of best subset selection methods, which can be regarded as a specific form of penalized likelihood, is computationally too expensive for many modern statistical applications. Other forms of penalized likelihood methods have been successfully developed over the last decade to cope with high dimensionality. They have been widely applied for simultaneously selecting important variables and estimating their effects in high dimensional statistical inference. In this article, we present a brief account of the recent developments of theory, methods, and implementations for high dimensional variable selection. What limits of the dimensionality such methods can handle, what the role of penalty functions is, and what the statistical properties are rapidly drive the advances of the field. The properties of non-concave penalized likelihood and its roles in high dimensional statistical modeling are emphasized. We also review some recent advances in ultra-high dimensional variable selection, with emphasis on independence screening and two-scale methods.},

We have estimated the prevalence and underdiagnosis of COPD by disease severity defined by the British Thoracic Society (BTS) and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines. The impact of smoking was evaluated by the population attributable fraction of smoking in COPD.
METHODS: A random sample of 1500 responders of the third postal survey performed in 1996 of the Obstructive Lung Disease in Northern Sweden (OLIN) Studies' first cohort (6610 subjects recruited in 1985) were invited to structured interview and spirometry. One thousand two hundred and thirty-seven subjects (82\%) performed spirometry.
RESULTS: The prevalence of mild BTS-COPD was 5.3\%, moderate 2.2\%, and severe 0.6\% (GOLD-COPD: mild 8.2\%, moderate 5.3\%, severe 0.7\%, and very severe 0.1\%). All subjects with severe COPD were symptomatic, corresponding figures among mild COPD were 88\% and 70\% (BTS and GOLD), Subjects with severe BTS-COPD reported a physician-diagnosis consistent with COPD in 50\% of cases, in mild BTS-COPD 19\%, while in mild GOLD-COPD only 5\% of cases. The major risk factors, age and smoking, had a synergistic effect on the COPD-prevalence. The Odds Ratio (OR) for having COPD among smokers aged 76-77 years was 59 and 34 (BTS and GOLD) when non-smokers aged 46-47 was used as reference population.
CONCLUSIONS: Most subjects with COPD have a mild disease. The underdiagnosis is related to disease-severity. Though being symptomatic, only a half of the subjects with severe COPD are properly labelled. Smoking and increasing age were the major risk factors and acted synergistic.},

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains one of the leading causes of disability and death in the developed world, and is emerging as increasingly important in the developing world. Despite its importance, COPD is not well recognised by the general public and frequently goes undiagnosed in people who have evidence of it. This underdiagnosis of people with evidence of obstruction on spirometry (generally adults with an FEV1/FVC ratio {\textless}70\%) has been previously documented in the United States1 and Korea.2

The paper by Shahab and colleagues in this issue of Thorax shows that underdiagnosis and, in all likelihood, misdiagnosis, is a factor in England also.3 Their key finding was that 13.3\% of the population aged 35 and older had evidence of COPD that would, in general, correspond to GOLD stage 1 or more severe disease.4 Bronchodilator response was not evaluated, so this would not meet strict GOLD criteria and, if this population is similar to the Norwegian adult population,5 one might expect the “post-bronchodilator” prevalence of COPD to be 20–25\% lower. Whether this shifting classification is important either clinically or epidemiologically is unclear. While some research has suggested that bronchodilator responsiveness …},

	abstract = {Background
People with known risk factors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are important targets for screening and early intervention. We sought to measure the prevalence of COPD among such individuals visiting a primary care practitioner for any reason. We also evaluated the accuracy of prior diagnosis or nondiagnosis of COPD and identified associated clinical characteristics.

Methods
We recruited patients from three primary care sites who were 40 years or older and had a smoking history of at least 20 pack-years. Participants were asked about respiratory symptoms and underwent postbronchodilator spirometry. COPD was defined as a ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) of less than 0.7 and an FEV1 of less than 80\% predicted.

Results
Of the 1459 patients who met the study criteria, 1003 (68.7\%) completed spirometry testing. Of these, 208 were found to have COPD, for a prevalence of 20.7\% (95\% confidence interval 18.3\%–23.4\%). Of the 205 participants with COPD who completed the interview about respiratory symptoms before spirometry, only 67 (32.7\%) were aware of their diagnosis before the study. Compared with patients in whom COPD had been correctly diagnosed before the study, those in whom COPD had been over-diagnosed or undiagnosed were similar in terms of age, sex, current smoking status and number of visits to a primary care practitioner because of a respiratory problem.

Interpretation
Among adult patients visiting a primary care practitioner, as many as one in five with known risk factors met spirometric criteria for COPD. Underdiagnosis of COPD was frequent, which suggests a need for greater screening of at-risk individuals. Knowledge of the prevalence of COPD will help plan strategies for disease management.},

It might be argued that doctors never prognosticate, working always in the present, but studies of medical decision making show this is untrue.10 11 Some doctors might claim that they can foretell patient outcomes better than any statistical model, but again there is contrary evidence.9 12 A journal editor's view might be that most published models reflect preliminary work and need further research before clinical adoption.13 Finally, some models predict events that are of no clinical relevance or do not generate predictions in time to inform clinical decisions, suggesting that their developers wished merely to publish journal articles, not build clinically useful tools.14

We anticipate that this framework will revitalize the use of predictive or prognostic research in endocrinology, leading to active applications in real clinical practice.},

We analysed data from 3 years follow-up in 178 women and 464 men with COPD, participants in the Euroscop Study who were smokers unexposed to inhaled corticosteroids.
METHODS: Explanatory variables of gender, age, starting age and pack-years smoking, respiratory symptoms, FEV(1)\%FVC and FEV(1)\%IVC (clinically important measures of airway obstruction), body mass index (BMI), and change in smoking were included in multiple linear regression models with baseline and change in post-bronchodilator FEV(1) as dependent variables.
RESULTS: Reduced baseline FEV(1) was associated with respiratory symptoms in men only. Annual decline in FEV(1) was not associated with respiratory symptoms in either men or women, and was 55 ml less in obese men (BMI 30 kg/m(2)) than men having normal BMI, an effect not seen in women. It was 32 ml faster in women with FEV(1)\%FVC{\textless}median than women with less airway obstruction, a larger difference than in men (8 ml per year). It was 17.7 ml/year faster when increasing the daily number of cigarettes by 10 in men only, but not significantly greater than in women.
CONCLUSION: Respiratory symptoms were associated with reduced baseline FEV(1) in men with COPD. In men, obesity was associated with reduced decline and increasing the number of cigarettes smoked with increased decline in lung function. In women more severe airway obstruction was associated with accelerated decline.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The SCORE project was initiated to develop a risk scoring system for use in the clinical management of cardiovascular risk in European clinical practice.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The project assembled a pool of datasets from 12 European cohort studies, mainly carried out in general population settings. There were 20,5178 persons (88,080 women and 11,7098 men) representing 2.7 million person years of follow-up. There were 7934 cardiovascular deaths, of which 5652 were deaths from coronary heart disease. Ten-year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease was calculated using a Weibull model in which age was used as a measure of exposure time to risk rather than as a risk factor. Separate estimation equations were calculated for coronary heart disease and for non-coronary cardiovascular disease. These were calculated for high-risk and low-risk regions of Europe. Two parallel estimation models were developed, one based on total cholesterol and the other on total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio. The risk estimations are displayed graphically in simple risk charts. Predictive value of the risk charts was examined by applying them to persons aged 45-64; areas under ROC curves ranged from 0.71 to 0.84.
CONCLUSIONS: The SCORE risk estimation system offers direct estimation of total fatal cardiovascular risk in a format suited to the constraints of clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Background—The objective of this study was to examine the association of Joint National Committee (JNC-V) blood pressure and National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) cholesterol categories with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, to incorporate them into coronary prediction algorithms, and to compare the discrimination properties of this approach with other noncategorical prediction functions.
Methods and Results—This work was designed as a prospective, single-center study in the setting of a community-based cohort. The patients were 2489 men and 2856 women 30 to 74 years old at baseline with 12 years of follow-up. During the 12 years of follow-up, a total of 383 men and 227 women developed CHD, which was significantly associated with categories of blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol (all P{\textless}.001). Sex-specific prediction equations were formulated to predict CHD risk according to age, diabetes, smoking, JNC-V blood pressure categories, and NCEP total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol categories. The accuracy of this categorical approach was found to be comparable to CHD prediction when the continuous variables themselves were used. After adjustment for other factors, ≈28\% of CHD events in men and 29\% in women were attributable to blood pressure levels that exceeded high normal (≥130/85). The corresponding multivariable-adjusted attributable risk percent associated with elevated total cholesterol (≥200 mg/dL) was 27\% in men and 34\% in women.
Conclusions—Recommended guidelines of blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol effectively predict CHD risk in a middle-aged white population sample. A simple coronary disease prediction algorithm was developed using categorical variables, which allows physicians to predict multivariate CHD risk in patients without overt CHD.},

Subjects (n = 5573) were original and offspring subjects in the Framingham Heart Study, aged 30 to 74 years, and initially free of cardiovascular disease. Equations to predict risk for the following were developed: myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease (CHD), death from CHD, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and death from cardiovascular disease. The equations demonstrated the potential importance of controlling multiple risk factors (blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, glucose intolerance, and left ventricular hypertrophy) as opposed to focusing on one single risk factor. The parametric model used was seen to have several advantages over existing standard regression models. Unlike logistic regression, it can provide predictions for different lengths of time, and probabilities can be expressed in a more straightforward way than the Cox proportional hazards model.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of prediction models for risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population.
DESIGN: Systematic review.
DATA SOURCES: Medline and Embase until June 2013.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY SELECTION: Studies describing the development or external validation of a multivariable model for predicting CVD risk in the general population.
RESULTS: 9965 references were screened, of which 212 articles were included in the review, describing the development of 363 prediction models and 473 external validations. Most models were developed in Europe (n=167, 46\%), predicted risk of fatal or non-fatal coronary heart disease (n=118, 33\%) over a 10 year period (n=209, 58\%). The most common predictors were smoking (n=325, 90\%) and age (n=321, 88\%), and most models were sex specific (n=250, 69\%). Substantial heterogeneity in predictor and outcome definitions was observed between models, and important clinical and methodological information were often missing. The prediction horizon was not specified for 49 models (13\%), and for 92 (25\%) crucial information was missing to enable the model to be used for individual risk prediction. Only 132 developed models (36\%) were externally validated and only 70 (19\%) by independent investigators. Model performance was heterogeneous and measures such as discrimination and calibration were reported for only 65\% and 58\% of the external validations, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an excess of models predicting incident CVD in the general population. The usefulness of most of the models remains unclear owing to methodological shortcomings, incomplete presentation, and lack of external validation and model impact studies. Rather than developing yet another similar CVD risk prediction model, in this era of large datasets, future research should focus on externally validating and comparing head-to-head promising CVD risk models that already exist, on tailoring or even combining these models to local settings, and investigating whether these models can be extended by addition of new predictors.},

This paper will highlight epidemiologic, clinical and experimental data on the effects of wine and distilled spirits [and the chemical components thereof] on lung function, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease progression, lung cancer risk, risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome, high altitude pulmonary edema and wine [sulfite] associated asthma. Several studies have demonstrated a positive [beneficial] effect of light-to-moderate wine consumption on pulmonary function, while chronic ingestion of distilled spirits may have either no effect, or a negative effect. Studies in Scandinavia, Europe and South America have suggested a possible protective effect of wine ingestion against lung cancer, especially adenocarcinoma. Resveratrol [3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene] a polyphenolic compound found in red wine, has anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and estrogen agonist effects and may be responsible for some of the health benefits of wine. The spectrum of potentially beneficial clinical effects of resveratrol and other wine-derived compounds is discussed.},

	abstract = {Background The aim of this study was to estimate the long-term (cost-) effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Methods A systematic review was performed of randomised controlled trials on smoking cessation interventions in patients with COPD reporting 12-month biochemical validated abstinence rates. The different interventions were grouped into four categories: usual care, minimal counselling, intensive counselling and intensive counselling + pharmacotherapy (‘pharmacotherapy’). For each category the average 12-month continuous abstinence rate and intervention costs were estimated. A dynamic population model for COPD was used to project the long-term (cost-) effectiveness (25 years) of 1-year implementation of the interventions for 50\% of the patients with COPD who smoked compared with usual care. Uncertainty and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed for variations in the calculation of the abstinence rates, the type of projection, intervention costs and discount rates.
Results Nine studies were selected. The average 12-month continuous abstinence rates were estimated to be 1.4\% for usual care, 2.6\% for minimal counselling, 6.0\% for intensive counselling and 12.3\% for pharmacotherapy. Compared with usual care, the costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for minimal counselling, intensive counselling and pharmacotherapy were €16 900, €8200 and €2400, respectively. The results were most sensitive to variations in the estimation of the abstinence rates and discount rates.
Conclusion Compared with usual care, intensive counselling and pharmacotherapy resulted in low costs per QALY gained with ratios comparable to results for smoking cessation in the general population. Compared with intensive counselling, pharmacotherapy was cost saving and dominated the other interventions.},

Demographics, clinical, and post-bronchodilator spirometry data were collected at an in-person study visit. The kappa statistic (κ) was used to evaluate agreement. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify patient characteristics associated with meeting the trial reference standard.Measurements and Main Results: A total of 998 (82.8\%) of 1,206 study participants met at least one case definition for COPD (of the 998: 91\% using ICD-9 codes, 73\% using patient-reported physician diagnosis, 56\% using trial reference standard); agreement between case definitions was poor (κ = 0.20–0.26). Lack of airflow obstruction was the principal (89\%) reason patients identified as having COPD did not meet the trial reference standard. Patients who were black (vs. white), obese (vs. normal weight), or had depression (vs. not) were less likely to meet the trial reference standard (odds ratio [95\% CI], 0.37 [0.26–0.53], 0.51 [0.34–0.75], 0.53 [0.40–0.71], respectively).Conclusions: Findings highlight concerns about the applicability of findings in clinical trials to patients meeting other case definitions for COPD.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a manageable respiratory condition, is the third leading cause of death worldwide. Knowing which prescription medications are the most effective in improving health outcomes for people with COPD is essential to maximizing health outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term benefits of combination long-acting β-agonists (LABAs) and inhaled corticosteroids compared with LABAs alone in a real-world setting.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Population-based, longitudinal cohort study conducted in Ontario, Canada, from 2003 to 2011. All individuals aged 66 years or older who met a validated case definition of COPD on the basis of health administrative data were included. After propensity score matching, there were 8712 new users of LABA-inhaled corticosteroid combination therapy and 3160 new users of LABAs alone who were followed up for median times of 2.7 years and 2.5 years, respectively.
EXPOSURES: Newly prescribed combination LABAs and inhaled corticosteroids or LABAs alone.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Composite outcome of death and COPD hospitalization.
RESULTS: The main outcome was observed among 5594 new users of LABAs and inhaled corticosteroids (3174 deaths [36.4\%]; 2420 COPD hospitalizations [27.8\%]) and 2129 new users of LABAs alone (1179 deaths [37.3\%]; 950 COPD hospitalizations [30.1\%]). New use of LABAs and inhaled corticosteroids was associated with a modestly reduced risk of death or COPD hospitalization compared with new use of LABAs alone (difference in composite outcome at 5 years, -3.7\%; 95\% CI, -5.7\% to -1.7\%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.88-0.96). The greatest difference was among COPD patients with a codiagnosis of asthma (difference in composite at 5 years, -6.5\%; 95\% CI, -10.3\% to -2.7\%; HR, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.77-0.91) and those who were not receiving inhaled long-acting anticholinergic medication (difference in composite at 5 years, -8.4\%; 95\% CI, -11.9\% to -4.9\%; HR, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.73-0.86).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among older adults with COPD, particularly those with asthma and those not receiving a long-acting anticholinergic medication, newly prescribed LABA and inhaled corticosteroid combination therapy, compared with newly prescribed LABAs alone, was associated with a significantly lower risk of the composite outcome of death or COPD hospitalization.},

	issn = {1488-2329},
	doi = {10.1503/cmaj.091784},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: People with known risk factors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are important targets for screening and early intervention. We sought to measure the prevalence of COPD among such individuals visiting a primary care practitioner for any reason. We also evaluated the accuracy of prior diagnosis or nondiagnosis of COPD and identified associated clinical characteristics.
METHODS: We recruited patients from three primary care sites who were 40 years or older and had a smoking history of at least 20 pack-years. Participants were asked about respiratory symptoms and underwent postbronchodilator spirometry. COPD was defined as a ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration to forced vital capacity (FEV(1)/FVC) of less than 0.7 and an FEV(1) of less than 80\% predicted.
RESULTS: Of the 1459 patients who met the study criteria, 1003 (68.7\%) completed spirometry testing. Of these, 208 were found to have COPD, for a prevalence of 20.7\% (95\% confidence interval 18.3\%-23.4\%). Of the 205 participants with COPD who completed the interview about respiratory symptoms before spirometry, only 67 (32.7\%) were aware of their diagnosis before the study. Compared with patients in whom COPD had been correctly diagnosed before the study, those in whom COPD had been over-diagnosed or undiagnosed were similar in terms of age, sex, current smoking status and number of visits to a primary care practitioner because of a respiratory problem.
INTERPRETATION: Among adult patients visiting a primary care practitioner, as many as one in five with known risk factors met spirometric criteria for COPD. Underdiagnosis of COPD was frequent, which suggests a need for greater screening of at-risk individuals. Knowledge of the prevalence of COPD will help plan strategies for disease management.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are common diseases with a heterogeneous distribution worldwide. Here, we present methods and disease and risk estimates for COPD and asthma from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) 2015 study. The GBD study provides annual updates on estimates of deaths, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a summary measure of fatal and non-fatal disease outcomes, for over 300 diseases and injuries, for 188 countries from 1990 to the most recent year.
METHODS: We estimated numbers of deaths due to COPD and asthma using the GBD Cause of Death Ensemble modelling (CODEm) tool. First, we analysed data from vital registration and verbal autopsy for the aggregate category of all chronic respiratory diseases. Subsequently, models were run for asthma and COPD relying on covariates to predict rates in countries that have incomplete or no vital registration data. Disease estimates for COPD and asthma were based on systematic reviews of published papers, unpublished reports, surveys, and health service encounter data from the USA. We used the Global Initiative of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease spirometry-based definition as the reference for COPD and a reported diagnosis of asthma with current wheeze as the definition of asthma. We used a Bayesian meta-regression tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, to derive estimates of prevalence and incidence. We estimated population-attributable fractions for risk factors for COPD and asthma from exposure data, relative risks, and a theoretical minimum exposure level. Results were stratified by Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure of income per capita, mean years of education over the age of 15 years, and total fertility rate.
FINDINGS: In 2015, 3·2 million people (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1 million to 3·3 million) died from COPD worldwide, an increase of 11·6\% (95\% UI 5·3 to 19·8) compared with 1990. There was a decrease in age-standardised death rate of 41·9\% (37·7 to 45·1) but this was counteracted by population growth and ageing of the global population. From 1990 to 2015, the prevalence of COPD increased by 44·2\% (41·7 to 46·6), whereas age-standardised prevalence decreased by 14·7\% (13·5 to 15·9). In 2015, 0·40 million people (0·36 million to 0·44 million) died from asthma, a decrease of 26·7\% (-7·2 to 43·7) from 1990, and the age-standardised death rate decreased by 58·8\% (39·0 to 69·0). The prevalence of asthma increased by 12·6\% (9·0 to 16·4), whereas the age-standardised prevalence decreased by 17·7\% (15·1 to 19·9). Age-standardised DALY rates due to COPD increased until the middle range of the SDI before reducing sharply. Age-standardised DALY rates due to asthma in both sexes decreased monotonically with rising SDI. The relation between with SDI and DALY rates due to asthma was attributed to variation in years of life lost (YLLs), whereas DALY rates due to COPD varied similarly for YLLs and years lived with disability across the SDI continuum. Smoking and ambient particulate matter were the main risk factors for COPD followed by household air pollution, occupational particulates, ozone, and secondhand smoke. Together, these risks explained 73·3\% (95\% UI 65·8 to 80·1) of DALYs due to COPD. Smoking and occupational asthmagens were the only risks quantified for asthma in GBD, accounting for 16·5\% (14·6 to 18·7) of DALYs due to asthma.
INTERPRETATION: Asthma was the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease worldwide in 2015, with twice the number of cases of COPD. Deaths from COPD were eight times more common than deaths from asthma. In 2015, COPD caused 2·6\% of global DALYs and asthma 1·1\% of global DALYs. Although there are laudable international collaborative efforts to make surveys of asthma and COPD more comparable, no consensus exists on case definitions and how to measure disease severity for population health measurements like GBD. Comparisons between countries and over time are important, as much of the chronic respiratory burden is either preventable or treatable with affordable interventions.

Methods We conducted a cross sectional retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries with COPD who had at least one hospitalization in 2010. We examined the process measures of receipt of spirometry evaluation, influenza and pneumococcal vaccine, use of COPD medications, and referral to a pulmonary specialist visit. Outcome measures were emergency department (ER) visit, number of hospitalizations and 30-day readmission in 2010.   Results A total of 7,257 Medicare beneficiaries with COPD were included. Of these, 1,999 and 5,258 received primary care from APPs and primary care physicians, respectively. Patients in the APP group were more likely to be white, younger, male, residing in non-metropolitan areas and have fewer comorbidities. In terms of process of care measures, APPs were more likely to prescribe short acting bronchodilators (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.18, 95\%Confidence Interval [CI] 1.05–1.32), oxygen therapy (aOR = 1.25, 95\% CI 1.12–1.40) and consult a pulmonary specialist (aOR = 1.39, 95\% CI 1.23–1.56), but less likely to give influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. Patients receiving care from APPs had lower rates of ER visits for COPD (aOR = 0.84, 95\%CI 0.71–0.98) and had a higher follow-up rate with pulmonary specialist within 30 days of hospitalization for COPD (aOR = 1.25, 95\%CI 1.07–1.48) than those cared for by physicians.   Conclusions Compared to patients cared for by physicians, patients cared for by APPs were more likely to receive short acting bronchodilator, oxygen therapy and been referred to pulmonologist, however they had lower rates of vaccination probably due to lower age group. Patients cared for by APPs were less like to visit an ER for COPD compared to patients care for by physicians, conversely there was no differences in hospitalization or readmission for COPD between MDs and APPs.},

To assess the role of doctors who patients report as responsible of their disease, in moderate–severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), describing characteristics of patients and treatments use according to each type of doctor, and relating it to the way of access to hospital at the time of an exacerbation. A systematic sample of 1:2 patients admitted for a COPD exacerbation during 1 year in four tertiary hospitals in the Barcelona area, Spain, was recruited. Information about health services was obtained by an administered questionnaire. A total of 346 patients were recruited: mean age 69 (±9) years, percent of predicted FEV1 of 35 (±16)\%, PO2 of 64 (±13)mmHg. At the time of admission, 17\% of patients reported being controlled by a general practitioner (GP) and 56\% by a pneumologist whereas 21\% reported its COPD not being under the regular control of any doctor. Patients not controlled by a pneumologist did not suffer from milder COPD than the remaining, but were less likely to receive pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments and less likely to perform correctly the inhalation manoeuvres. During the course of the exacerbation 70\% of patients reported a visit to a hospital emergency room department without a previous medical visit, this proportion being higher among those controlled by a pneumologist. Lack of control and variability in the patterns of care among patients controlled by different types of physicians are common in moderate-to-severe COPD patients admitted for a COPD exacerbation, despite the lack of differences in COPD severity. Medical control of COPD patients needs more investigation and a wider inclusion in international guidelines.},

	abstract = {Summary
Administrative claims are an important data source for COPD research but lack a validated measure of patient COPD severity, which is an important determinant of treatment and outcomes. Patients with ≥1 diagnosis of COPD and spirometry results from 01/2004-05/2011 were identified from an electronic health records database linked to healthcare claims. Patients were classified into 3 COPD severity groups based on spirometry and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines: GOLD-Unclassified, Mild/Moderate, and Severe/Very Severe. A multinomial logistic regression model was constructed using claims data from 3 months before and after (observation period) the most recent spirometry (index date) to categorize patient COPD severity. A random selection of 90\% of patients in each severity level was selected to build the model, and the remaining 10\% were used as a validation sample. Model predictions were evaluated for sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and concordance. Among 2028 COPD patients who met sample selection criteria, 886, 683, and 459 patients were in the GOLD-Unclassified, Mild/Moderate, and Severe/Very Severe categories, respectively. The final model included age, sex, comorbidities (such as pulmonary fibrosis and diabetes), COPD-related resource utilization (such as oxygen use), and all-cause healthcare utilization. In the validation sample, the model correctly predicted COPD severity for 62.7\% of all patients (accuracy for predicting GOLD-Unclassified: 73.5\%; Mild/Moderate: 70.6\%; Severe/Very Severe: 81.4\%) with kappa = 0.41. The prediction model was developed using clinically measured COPD severity to provide researchers an approach to classify patients using claims data when clinical measures are not available.},

The new classification has been validated in the United States and Europe, but validation in Asian patients is still lacking. We examined the abilities of the GOLD 2013 classification to predict clinical outcomes in Taiwanese patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Patients with COPD were recruited from January 2006 to December 2012 and followed up for exacerbation and mortality. The predictive abilities of various assessments were compared through logistic regression analysis using receiver operating curve (ROC) estimations and area under the curve (AUC). A total of 471 patients with COPD were analyzed. The GOLD 2013 groups at high risk of exacerbation (C and D) experienced a higher average number of exacerbations per year (2.1 ± 3.1 vs. 0.3 ± 1.0, p {\textless} 0.001) than the low risk groups (A and B). The mortality rates were 10.1\% in GOLD 2013 Group A, 14.1\% in Group B, 4.0\% in Group C, and 30.5\% in Group D. The AUC values for GOLD 2013 and GOLD 2007 were 0.78 versus 0.67 (p {\textless} 0.001) for exacerbation, and 0.66 versus 0.61 (p = 0.15) for mortality. The GOLD 2013 classification has powerful ability to predict exacerbation, but poor ability to predict mortality. The prognostic validity of the GOLD 2013 classification to predict exacerbations was better than the GOLD 2007 classification.},

Population-based health administrative databases provide a powerful and unbiased way of studying COPD in the population, however, their ability to accurately identify patients with this disease must first be confirmed. The objective was to validate population-based health administrative definitions of COPD. Previously abstracted medical records of adults over the age of 35 randomly selected from primary care practices in Ontario, Canada were reviewed by an expert panel to establish if an individual did or did not have a diagnosis of COPD. These reference designations were then linked to each individual's respective health administrative database record and compared with predefine health administrative data definitions of COPD. Concepts of diagnostic test evaluation were used to calculate and compare their test characteristics. The most sensitive health administrative definition of COPD was 1 or more ambulatory claims and/or 1 or more hospitalizations for COPD that yielded a sensitivity of 85.0\% (95\% confidence interval 77.0 to 91.0) and a specificity of 78.4\% (95\% confidence interval 73.6 to 82.7). As number of ambulatory claims in the definition increased, sensitivity decreased and specificity increased. Individuals with COPD can be accurately identified in health administrative data, and therefore it may be used to create an unbiased population cohort for surveillance and research. This offers a powerful means of generating evidence to inform strategies that optimize the prevention and management of COPD.},

Little information is available relating to the costs of asthma depending on the degree of severity of the disease. Total, direct and indirect costs generated by asthma patients who sought medical care for asthma control over a one-year period in a northern area of Spain were determined. Data were obtained from the patients themselves and severity of illness was classified into mild, moderate and severe according to the International Consensus Report on Diagnosis and Treatment of Asthma, 1992. The average total annual asthma-derived cost was estimated at US\$2,879 per patient, with averages of US\$1,336 in mildly asthmatic patients, US\$2,407 in moderate asthma and US\$6,393 in severe asthma. At all levels of severity, indirect costs were twice as high as direct costs, and at the same degree of severity, direct costs due to medication and hospitalization were higher among females than males. A minority of severe asthmatics incurred some 41\% of the total costs. The cost of asthma was surprisingly high and varied substantially depending on the degree of severity of the disease. Further knowledge of the costs of asthma across various levels of severity will contribute to a better characterization of optimal intervention strategies for asthma care.},

	abstract = {Background: Patients with COPD often experience severe exacerbations involving hospitalization, which accelerate lung function decline and reduce quality of life. This study aimed to develop and validate a predictive model to identify patients at risk of developing severe COPD exacerbations using administrative claims data, to facilitate appropriate disease management programs.
Methods: A predictive model was developed using a retrospective cohort of COPD patients aged 55–89 years identified between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2013 using Humana’s claims data. The baseline period was 12 months postdiagnosis, and the prediction period covered months 12–24. Patients with and without severe exacerbations in the prediction period were compared to identify characteristics associated with severe COPD exacerbations. Models were developed using stepwise logistic regression, and a final model was chosen to optimize sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative PV (NPV).
Results: Of 45,722 patients, 5,317 had severe exacerbations in the prediction period. Patients with severe exacerbations had significantly higher comorbidity burden, use of respiratory medications, and tobacco-cessation counseling compared to those without severe exacerbations in the baseline period. The predictive model included 29 variables that were significantly associated with severe exacerbations. The strongest predictors were prior severe exacerbations and higher Deyo–Charlson comorbidity score (OR 1.50 and 1.47, respectively). The best-performing predictive model had an area under the curve of 0.77. A receiver operating characteristic cutoff of 0.4 was chosen to optimize PPV, and the model had sensitivity of 17\%, specificity of 98\%, PPV of 48\%, and NPV of 90\%.
Conclusion: This study found that of every two patients identified by the predictive model to be at risk of severe exacerbation, one patient may have a severe exacerbation. Once at-risk patients are identified, appropriate maintenance medication, implementation of disease-management programs, and education may prevent future exacerbations.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Acute COPD exacerbations account for much of the rising disability and costs associated with COPD, but data on predictive risk factors are limited. The goal of the current study was to develop a robust, clinically based model to predict frequent exacerbation risk. Patients and methods: Patients identified from the Optimum Patient Care Research Database (OPCRD) with a diagnostic code for COPD and a forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio ,0.7 were included in this historical follow-up study if they were \$40 years old and had data encompassing the year before (predictor year) and year after (outcome year) study index date. The data set contained potential risk factors including demographic, clinical, and comorbid variables. Following univariable analysis, predictors of two or more exacerbations were fed into a stepwise multivariable logistic regression. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for subpopulations of patients without any asthma diagnosis ever and those with questionnaire data on symptoms and smoking pack-years. The full predictive model was validated against 1 year of prospective OPCRD data.
Results: The full data set contained 16,565 patients (53\% male, median age 70 years), including 9,393 patients without any recorded asthma and 3,713 patients with questionnaire data. The full model retained eleven variables that significantly predicted two or more exacerbations, of which the number of exacerbations in the preceding year had the strongest association; others included height, age, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and several comorbid conditions. Significant predictors not previously identified included eosinophilia and COPD Assessment Test score. The predictive ability of the full model (C statistic 0.751) changed little when applied to the validation data set (n=2,713; C statistic 0.735). Results of the sensitivity analyses supported the main findings.
Conclusion: Patients at risk of exacerbation can be identified from routinely available, computerized primary care data. Further study is needed to validate the model in other patient populations.},

Patients and methods: The derivation cohort consisted of patients aged 65 years or over, with a COPD diagnosis, who were followed up over 24 months. The external validation cohort consisted of another cohort of COPD patients, aged 50 years or over. Exacerbations of COPD were defined as symptomatic deterioration requiring pulsed oral steroid use or ­hospitalization. Logistic regression analysis including backward selection and shrinkage were used to develop the final model and to adjust for overfitting. The adjusted regression coefficients were applied in the validation cohort to assess calibration of the predictions and calculate changes in d­ iscrimination applying C-statistics.
Results: The derivation and validation cohort consisted of 240 and 793 patients with COPD, of whom 29\% and 28\%, respectively, experienced an exacerbation during follow-up. The final model included four easily assessable variables: exacerbations in the previous year, pack years of smoking, level of obstruction, and history of vascular disease, with a C-statistic of 0.75 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69–0.82). Predictions were well calibrated in the validation cohort, with a small loss in discrimination potential (C-statistic 0.66 [95\% CI 0.61–0.71]).
Conclusion: Our newly developed prediction model can help clinicians to predict the risk of future exacerbations in individual patients with COPD, including those with mild disease.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease often experience exacerbations. These events are important as they are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Recently, it has been increasingly recognized that patients may experience symptoms suggestive of an exacerbation but do not seek treatment, which are referred to as unreported or untreated exacerbations. Symptom diaries used in clinical trials have the benefit of identifying both treated and untreated exacerbation events.
Methods: The Kamada study was a multicenter, double-blind randomized controlled trial of inhaled augmentation therapy in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). A retrospective review of daily electronic symptom diary cards was undertaken from the two leading centers to identify symptomatic episodes consistent with a definition of an exacerbation. The aims were to explore the relationship between exacerbation events and classical “Anthonisen” symptoms and to characterize treated and untreated episodes.
Results: Forty-six AATD patients with airflow obstruction and history of exacerbations were included in the analysis. Two hundred thirty-three exacerbation episodes were identified: 103 untreated and 130 treated. Untreated episodes were significantly shorter (median 6 days; interquartile range [IQR] 3–10 days) than the treated episodes (median 10 days; IQR 5–18.25 days: P,0.001). Using logistic regression analysis, Anthonisen type and length of dyspnea were significant predictors of the treatment of an exacerbation event.
Conclusion: Real-time electronic diary cards provide valuable information about the characterization of exacerbations. Untreated episodes are common and are significantly shorter in duration than the treated episodes. Dyspnea is the most important single Anthonisen symptom in the prediction and/or driver of treatment.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Exacerbations are important outcomes in COPD both from a clinical and an economic perspective. Most studies investigating predictors of exacerbations were performed in COPD patients participating in pharmacological clinical trials who usually have moderate to severe airflow obstruction. This study was aimed to investigate whether predictors of COPD exacerbations depend on the COPD population studied.
Methods: A network of COPD health economic modelers used data from five COPD data sources – two population-based studies (COPDGene® and The Obstructive Lung Disease in Norrbotten), one primary care study (RECODE), and two studies in secondary care (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoint and UPLIFT) – to estimate and validate several prediction models for total and severe exacerbations (= hospitalization). The models differed in terms of predictors (depending on availability) and type of model.
Results: FEV1\% predicted and previous exacerbations were significant predictors of total exacerbations in all five data sources. Disease-specific quality of life and gender were predictors in four out of four and three out of five data sources, respectively. Age was significant only in the two studies including secondary care patients. Other significant predictors of total exacerbations available in one database were: presence of cough and wheeze, pack-years, 6-min walking distance, inhaled corticosteroid use, and oxygen saturation. Predictors of severe exacerbations were in general the same as for total exacerbations, but in addition low body mass index, cardiovascular disease, and emphysema were significant predictors of hospitalization for an exacerbation in secondary care patients.
Conclusions: FEV1\% predicted, previous exacerbations, and disease-specific quality of life were predictors of exacerbations in patients regardless of their COPD severity, while age, low body mass index, cardiovascular disease, and emphysema seem to be predictors in secondary care patients only.},

A possible approach is to stratify patients according to the risk of adverse outcomes such as exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Risk-stratified approaches are particularly attractive for drugs like inhaled corticosteroids or phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors that reduce exacerbations but are associated with harms. However, it is currently not clear which models are best to predict exacerbations in patients with COPD. Therefore, our aim was to identify and critically appraise studies on models that predict exacerbations in COPD patients. Out of 1382 studies, 25 studies with 27 prediction models were included. The prediction models showed great heterogeneity in terms of number and type of predictors, time horizon, statistical methods and measures of prediction model performance. Only two out of 25 studies validated the developed model, and only one out of 27 models provided estimates of individual exacerbation risk, only three out of 27 prediction models used high-quality statistical approaches for model development and evaluation. Overall, none of the existing models fulfilled the requirements for riskstratified treatment to personalise COPD care. A more harmonised approach to develop and validate highquality prediction models is needed to move personalised COPD medicine forward.},

	abstract = {Background
Most patients with asthma have mild disease. However, the clinical course of mild asthma and risk factors for progression are not well studied.
Objective
To examine the long-term trajectories of mild asthma and the effects of early-stage risk factors on the subsequent disease course.
Methods
From the administrative health data of British Columbia, Canada, we identified patients aged 14 to 45 years with newly diagnosed mild asthma between January 1997 and December 2012. For each follow-up year, we categorized a patient's asthma severity into mild/dormant, moderate, or severe on the basis of the intensity of asthma medications and occurrence of exacerbations. Ordinal logistic regression was used to estimate the probability of severity or all-cause death in the next year as a function of a patient's severity history in the past 3 years and selected baseline risk factors.
Results
The study included 70,829 patients with incident mild asthma (62\% women; mean age, 31 years). Over 10 years, 8\% of these patients transitioned to moderate or severe asthma. Inappropriate use of rescue medications and older age were the most influential determinants for progression from mild asthma (odds ratios, 1.79; 95\% CI, 1.68-1.90; P {\textless} .001; 1.24 per 10-year increase in age; 95\% CI, 1.22-1.27; P {\textless} .001), whereas the presence of allergic rhinitis had no significant effects (odds ratio, 0.95; 95\% CI, 0.91-1.00; P = .063).
Conclusions
Mild asthma remains largely stable over time. However, potentially modifiable factors such as inappropriate use of rescue medications are associated with a worsened prognosis.},

	abstract = {Prediction models are developed to aid health care providers in estimating the probability or risk that a specific disease or condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will occur in the future (prognostic models), to inform their decision making. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model studies is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced after a Web-based survey and revised during a 3-day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, health care professionals, and journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document. To aid the editorial process and readers of prediction model studies, it is recommended that authors include a completed checklist in their submission (also available at www.tripod-statement.org).

Up-to-date estimates of burden of diseases are required for evidence-based decision-making. The objectives of this study were to determine the excess costs of COPD and its trend from 2001 to 2010 in British Columbia, Canada.METHODS:
We used British Columbia’s administrative health data to construct a cohort of patients with COPD and a matched comparison cohort of subjects without COPD. We followed each patient from the time of first COPD-related health-care event (or equivalent time for the comparison cohort). Direct medical costs (in 2010 Canadian dollars [\$]) were calculated based on billing records pertaining to hospital admissions, outpatient services use, medication dispensations, and community care services. We determined the excess medical costs of COPD by calculating the difference in overall medical costs between the COPD and the comparison cohorts.RESULTS:
The COPD and comparison cohorts comprised 153,570 and 246,801 people, respectively (for both cohorts, mean age at entry was 66.9 years; 47.2\% female patients). The excess costs of COPD during the study period were \$5,452 per patient-year. Inpatient, outpatient, medication, and community care costs were responsible for 57\%, 16\%, 22\%, and 5\% of the excess costs, respectively. Excess costs increased by \$296/person-y (P {\textless} .01), with hospital costs demonstrating the largest increase over time (\$258/person-y; P {\textless} .01).CONCLUSIONS:
The direct economic burden of COPD is high and has increased significantly between 2001 and 2010 over and above the increase in the health-care costs of the general population. Further investigation is required to elucidate the underlying reasons for the temporal increase in COPD direct costs.},

	abstract = {Background: The rate of lung-function decline in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) varies substantially among individuals. We sought to develop and validate an individualized prediction model for forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) in current smokers with mild-to-moderate COPD.
Methods: Using data from a large long-term clinical trial (the Lung Health Study), we derived mixed-effects regression models to predict future FEV1 values over 11 years according to clinical traits. We modelled heterogeneity by allowing regression coefficients to vary across individuals. Two independent cohorts with COPD were used for validating the equations.
Results: We used data from 5594 patients (mean age 48.4 yr, 63\% men, mean baseline FEV1 2.75 L) to create the individualized prediction equations. There was significant between-individual variability in the rate of FEV1 decline, with the interval for the annual rate of decline that contained 95\% of individuals being -124 to -15 mL/yr for smokers and -83 to 15 mL/yr for sustained quitters. Clinical variables in the final model explained 88\% of variation around follow-up FEV1. The C statistic for predicting severity grades was 0.90. Prediction equations performed robustly in the 2 external data sets.
Interpretation: A substantial part of individual variation in FEV1 decline can be explained by easily measured clinical variables. The model developed in this work can be used for prediction of future lung health in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD. Trial registration: Lung Health Study - ClinicalTrials.gov, no.

The findings showed that forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) falls gradually over a lifetime, but in most non-smokers and many smokers clinically significant airflow obstruction never develops. In susceptible people, however, smoking causes irreversible obstructive changes. If a susceptible smoker stops smoking he will not recover his lung function, but the average further rates of loss of FEV1 will revert to normal. Therefore, severe or fatal obstructive lung disease could be prevented by screening smokers' lung function in early middle age if those with reduced function could be induced to stop smoking. Infective processes and chronic mucus hypersecretion do not cause chronic airflow obstruction to progress more rapidly. There are thus two largely unrelated disease processes, chronic airflow obstruction and the hypersecretory disorder (including infective processes).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of interventions on the progressive course of COPD is currently assessed by the slope of the annual decline in FEV₁ determined from serial measurements of the post-, in preference to the pre-, bronchodilator FEV₁. We therefore compared the yearly slope and the variability of the slope of the pre- versus the post-bronchodilator FEV₁ in men and women with mild to moderate COPD who participated in the 5-year Lung Health Study (LHS).
METHODS: Data were analyzed from 4484 of the 5887 LHS participants who had measurements of pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV₁ at baseline (screening visit 2) and all five annual visits. The annual rate of decline in FEV₁ (±SE) measured pre- and post-bronchodilator from the first to the fifth annual visit was estimated separately using a random coefficient model adjusted for relevant covariates. Analyses were performed separately within each of the three randomized intervention groups. In addition, individual rates of decline in pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV₁ were also determined for each participant. Furthermore, sample sizes were estimated for determining the significance of differences in slopes of decline between different interventions using pre- versus post-bronchodilator measurements.
RESULTS: Within each intervention group, mean adjusted and unadjusted slope estimates were slightly higher for the pre- than the post-bronchodilator FEV₁ (range of differences 2.6-5.2 ml/yr) and the standard errors around these estimates were only minimally higher for the pre- versus the post-bronchodilator FEV₁ (range 0.05-0.11 ml/yr). Conversely, the standard deviations of the mean FEV₁ determined at each annual visit were consistently slightly higher (range of differences 0.011 to 0.035 L) for the post- compared to the pre-bronchodilator FEV₁. Within each group, the proportion of individual participants with a statistically significant slope was similar (varying by only 1.4 to 2.7\%) comparing the estimates from the pre- versus the post-bronchodilator FEV₁. However, sample size estimates were slightly higher when the pre- compared to the post-bronchodilator value was used to determine the significance of specified differences in slopes between interventions.
CONCLUSION: Serial measurements of the pre-bronchodilator FEV₁ are generally sufficient for comparing the impact of different interventions on the annual rate of change in FEV₁.},

	abstract = {Background
The recent Global Initiative for Asthma management strategy recommends achieving symptom control and minimizing the future risk of poor outcomes as priorities for asthma management.
Objective
The objective was to quantify the association between symptom control and health-related quality of life in asthma.
Methods
In a prospectively recruited random sample of adults with asthma, we ascertained symptom control and measured health-related quality of life using a generic (EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire [EQ-5D]) and a disease-specific (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire) instrument, to estimate EQ-5D and five-dimensional Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQL-5D) utilities, respectively. We measured the adjusted difference in utilities across symptom control levels and calculated the loss of predictive efficiency due to aggregating multiple symptoms into one symptom control variable.
Results
The final sample included 958 observations from 494 individuals (mean age at baseline 52.2 ± 14.5 years; 67.0\% women). Asthma was symptomatically controlled, partially controlled, and uncontrolled in 269 (28.1\%), 367 (38.3\%), and 322 (33.6\%) observations, respectively. A person with symptomatically uncontrolled asthma would gain 0.0512 (95\% CI 0.0339–0.0686) in EQ-5D or 0.0802 (95\% CI 0.0693–0.0910) in AQL-5D utilities by achieving symptom control. The loss of predictive efficiency was 55.4\% and 27.6\% for EQ-5D and AQL-5D utilities, respectively.
Conclusions
Asthma symptom control status corresponds well with both generic and disease-specific quality-of-life measures. The trade-off, however, between ease of use and predictive power should be reconsidered in developing simplified measures of control. Our results have direct relevance in informing decision-analytic models of asthma and deducing the effect of interventions on quality of life through their impact on asthma control.},

This executive summary presents the main contents of the second 5-year revision of the GOLD document that has implemented some of the vast knowledge about COPD accumulated over the last years. Today, GOLD recommends that spirometry is required for the clinical diagnosis of COPD to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure proper evaluation of severity of airflow limitation. The document highlights that the assessment of the patient with COPD should always include assessment of (1) symptoms, (2) severity of airflow limitation, (3) history of exacerbations, and (4) comorbidities. The first three points can be used to evaluate level of symptoms and risk of future exacerbations, and this is done in a way that splits patients with COPD into four categories-A, B, C, and D. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of COPD match this assessment in an evidence-based attempt to relieve symptoms and reduce risk of exacerbations. Identification and treatment of comorbidities must have high priority, and a separate section in the document addresses management of comorbidities as well as COPD in the presence of comorbidities. The revised document also contains a new section on exacerbations of COPD. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of all relevant shareholders and will hopefully inspire future national and local guidelines on the management of COPD.},

It is the fourth leading cause of chronic morbidity and mortality in the United States, and is projected to rank fifth in 2020 in burden of disease worldwide, according to a study published by the World Bank/World Health Organization. Yet, COPD remains relatively unknown or ignored by the public as well as public health and government officials. In 1998, in an effort to bring more attention to COPD, its management, and its prevention, a committed group of scientists encouraged the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization to form the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). Among the important objectives of GOLD are to increase awareness of COPD and to help the millions of people who suffer from this disease and die prematurely of it or its complications. The first step in the GOLD program was to prepare a consensus report, Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD, published in 2001. The present, newly revised document follows the same format as the original consensus report, but has been updated to reflect the many publications on COPD that have appeared. GOLD national leaders, a network of international experts, have initiated investigations of the causes and prevalence of COPD in their countries, and developed innovative approaches for the dissemination and implementation of COPD management guidelines. We appreciate the enormous amount of work the GOLD national leaders have done on behalf of their patients with COPD. Despite the achievements in the 5 years since the GOLD report was originally published, considerable additional work is ahead of us if we are to control this major public health problem. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of governments, public health officials, health care workers, and the general public, but a concerted effort by all involved in health care will be necessary.},

METHODS: We analyzed current asthma prevalence using 2001–2013 National Health Interview Survey data for children ages 0 to 17 years. Logistic regression with quadratic terms was used to test for nonlinear patterns in trends. Differences between demographic subgroups were further assessed with multivariate models controlling for gender, age, poverty status, race/ethnicity, urbanicity, and geographic region.
RESULTS: Overall, childhood asthma prevalence increased from 2001 to 2009 followed by a plateau then a decline in 2013. From 2001 to 2013, multivariate logistic regression showed no change in prevalence among non-Hispanic white and Puerto Rican children and those in the Northeast and West; increasing prevalence among 10- to 17-year-olds, poor children, and those living in the South; increasing then plateauing prevalence among 5- to 9-year-olds, near-poor children, and non-Hispanic black children; and increasing then decreasing prevalence among 0- to 4-year-olds, nonpoor, and Mexican children and those in the Midwest. Non-Hispanic black-white disparities stopped increasing, and Puerto Rican children remained with the highest prevalence.
CONCLUSIONS: Current asthma prevalence ceased to increase among children in recent years and the non-Hispanic black-white disparity stopped increasing due mainly to plateauing prevalence among non-Hispanic black children.},

	abstract = {Background
Little is known about asthma trend in Morocco, particularly in early childhood. Furthermore, when dealing with asthma related environmental risk factors in Morocco, decision-making focus is in one region R9, while 16 regions make up the country. This work aims at studying 9-year trends in consultations for asthma in under-5 children in the 16 individual regions with respect to area and age group.

Methods
Direct method use, based on the only available national data from the open access files of the ministry of health, standardizing data for three age groups (0–11 ; 12–23 and 24–59 months). We compared age-adjusted rates, stratified by area (urban and rural areas) within each region (Wilcoxon's signed ranks test), and between all regions emphasizing on R9. Secular trends are examined (Kendall's rank correlation test). We also compared directly standardized rates as a rate ratio for two study populations (that of R9 and any region with highest rates). We finally compared rates by age group in selected regions.

Results
Secular increase in prevalence rates was shown in both urban and rural Morocco, particularly in urban areas of R10, R14, R16 and R5, and in rural areas of R14 and R16. In urban area of R10 (the highest age-adjusted prevalence rates area) the rates showed secular increase from 6.82 at 95 \% CI = [6.44 to 7.19] per 1000 childhood population in 2004 to 20.91 at 95 \% CI = [20.26 to 21.56] per 1000 childhood population in 2012 (P = 0.001). Rates were higher in urban than rural Morocco, particularly in R8, R9, R10, R14, R15 ; R6 was an exception. Rates in R10 were 1.63 higher than that in R9 in 2004 and rose to be 2.55 higher in 2012 ; rates in urban area of R14, about 3 times lower than that in R9 in 2004, increased to be similar in 2012. The highest-prevalence age group varied according to region and area.

Discussion
The regions that worth decision making attention are the urban areas of R10 (the highest prevalence rates Moroccan area, showing continuous increase), of R9, of R14 and the rural area of R6. The rates in the urban area of R9 (a current continuous decision making focus) remained high but stable within the study period and less important than those in R10. Environmental factors (biological particules, non-biological particules or gazes) are suspected.The potential unavailability of treatment at regular basis at the primary health care centers may reduce frequency of consultations for asthma in early childhood : outpatients may consult only if asthma causes problems in an attempt to get free medicines ; chances of outpatients' follow-up by the primary health care center's physicians are therefore reduced and optimal asthma control is not achieved.

Conclusion
Social, health care policy and environmental factors, to which decision-making has to be responsive, are suspected to be affecting both frequency of and time secular trend in consultations for asthma in early childhood in Morocco.

Abstract Asthma prevalence has increased very considerably in recent decades such that it is now one of the commonest chronic disorders in the world. Recent evidence from epidemiological studies, however, suggests that the prevalence of asthma may now be declining in many parts of the world, which, if true is important for health service planning and also because this offers the possibility of generating and testing new aetiological hypotheses. Our objective was to determine whether the prevalence of asthma is declining worldwide. We undertook a systematic search of EMBASE, Medline, Web of Science and Google Scholar, for high quality reports of cohort studies, repeat cross-sectional studies and analyses of routine healthcare datasets to examine international trends in asthma prevalence in children and adults for the period 1990–2008. There were 48 full reports of studies that satisfied our inclusion criteria. The large volume of data identified clearly indicate that there are, at present, no overall signs of a declining trend in asthma prevalence; on the contrary, asthma prevalence is in many parts of the world still increasing. The reductions in emergency healthcare utilization being reported in some economically developed countries most probably reflect improvements in quality of care. There remain major gaps in the literature on asthma trends in relation to Africa and parts of Asia. There is no overall global downward trend in the prevalence of asthma. Healthcare planners will for the foreseeable future, therefore, need to continue with high levels of anticipated expenditure in relation to provision of asthma care.},

	abstract = {Background: Recent data suggest that the previously rising trend in childhood wheezing symptoms has plateaued in some regions. We sought to investigate sex-specific trends in wheeze, asthma, allergic conditions, allergic sensitization and risk factors for wheeze. Methods: We compared two population-based cohorts of 7 to 8-year olds from the same Swedish towns in 1996 and 2006 using parental expanded ISAAC questionnaires. In 1996, 3430 (97\%) and in 2006, 2585 (96\%) questionnaires were completed. A subset was skin prick tested: in 1996, 2148 (88\%) and in 2006, 1700 (90\%) children participated. Results: No significant change in the prevalence of current wheeze (P = 0.13), allergic rhinitis (P = 0.18) or eczema (P = 0.22) was found despite an increase in allergic sensitization (20.6–29.9\%, P {\textless} 0.01). In boys, however, the prevalence of current wheeze (12.9–16.4\%, P {\textless} 0.01), physician-diagnosed asthma (7.1–9.3\%, P = 0.03) and asthma medication use increased. In girls the prevalence of current symptoms and conditions tended to decrease. The prevalence of all studied risk factors for wheeze and asthma increased in boys relative to girls from 1996 to 2006, thus increasing the boy-to-girl prevalence ratio in risk factors. Conclusions: The previously reported increase in current wheezing indices has plateaued in Sweden. Due to increased diagnostic activity, physician diagnoses continue to increase. Time trends in wheezing symptoms differed between boys and girls, and current wheeze increased in boys. This was seemingly explained by the observed increases in the prevalence of risk factors for asthma in boys compared with girls. In contrast to the current symptoms of wheeze, rhinitis or eczema, the prevalence of allergic sensitization increased considerably.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: The relationship between longitudinal lung function trajectories, chest computed tomography (CT) imaging, and genetic predisposition to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has not been explored.
OBJECTIVES: 1) To model trajectories using a data-driven approach applied to longitudinal data spanning adulthood in the Normative Aging Study (NAS), and 2) to apply these models to demographically similar subjects in the COPDGene (Genetic Epidemiology of COPD) Study with detailed phenotypic characterization including chest CT.
METHODS: We modeled lung function trajectories in 1,060 subjects in NAS with a median follow-up time of 29 years. We assigned 3,546 non-Hispanic white males in COPDGene to these trajectories for further analysis. We assessed phenotypic and genetic differences between trajectories and across age strata.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified four trajectories in NAS with differing levels of maximum lung function and rate of decline. In COPDGene, 617 subjects (17\%) were assigned to the lowest trajectory and had the greatest radiologic burden of disease (P {\textless} 0.01); 1,283 subjects (36\%) were assigned to a low trajectory with evidence of airway disease preceding emphysema on CT; 1,411 subjects (40\%) and 237 subjects (7\%) were assigned to the remaining two trajectories and tended to have preserved lung function and negligible emphysema. The genetic contribution to these trajectories was as high as 83\% (P = 0.02), and membership in lower lung function trajectories was associated with greater parental histories of COPD, decreased exercise capacity, greater dyspnea, and more frequent COPD exacerbations.
CONCLUSIONS: Data-driven analysis identifies four lung function trajectories. Trajectory membership has a genetic basis and is associated with distinct lung structural abnormalities.},

	abstract = {Cigarette smoking is the main risk factor for COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), yet only a subset of smokers develops COPD. Family members of patients with severe early-onset COPD have an increased risk to develop COPD and are therefore defined as "susceptible individuals". Here we perform unbiased analyses of proteomic profiles to assess how "susceptible individuals" differ from age-matched "non-susceptible individuals" in response to cigarette smoking. Epithelial lining fluid (ELF) was collected at baseline and 24 hours after smoking 3 cigarettes in young individuals susceptible or non-susceptible to develop COPD and older subjects with established COPD. Controls at baseline were older healthy smoking and non-smoking individuals. Five samples per group were pooled and analysed by stable isotope labelling (iTRAQ) in duplicate. Six proteins were selected and validated by ELISA or immunohistochemistry. After smoking, 23 proteins increased or decreased in young susceptible individuals, 7 in young non-susceptible individuals, and 13 in COPD in the first experiment; 23 proteins increased or decreased in young susceptible individuals, 32 in young non-susceptible individuals, and 11 in COPD in the second experiment. SerpinB3 and Uteroglobin decreased after acute smoke exposure in young non-susceptible individuals exclusively, whereas Peroxiredoxin I, S100A9, S100A8, ALDH3A1 (Aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1) decreased both in young susceptible and non-susceptible individuals, changes being significantly different between groups for Uteroglobin with iTRAQ and for Serpin B3 with iTRAQ and ELISA measures. Peroxiredoxin I, SerpinB3 and ALDH3A1 increased in COPD patients after smoking. We conclude that smoking induces a differential protein response in ELF of susceptible and non-susceptible young individuals, which differs from patients with established COPD. This is the first study applying unbiased proteomic profiling to unravel the underlying mechanisms that induce COPD. Our data suggest that SerpinB3 and Uteroglobin could be interesting proteins in understanding the processes leading to COPD.},

	abstract = {Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is a chronic inflammatory disorder. We evaluated whether white blood cell (WBC) count, is associated with the severity of COPD, independent of other inflammatory conditions, such as metabolic syndrome.

Methods
The WBC counts were compared between 1227 COPD patients and 8679 non-COPD adults older than 40. The relationships between the WBC count, lung function, and symptoms score in COPD patients, were determined, using general linear regression analyses.

Results
The WBC count was negatively associated with forced vital capacity (FVC, L), FVC (\% predicted), forced expiry volume in one second (FEV1, L), and FEV1 (\% predicted) in COPD patients. Additionally, the WBC count was independently associated with the quality of life measure, by EQ5D-index score. However, this relationship between WBC count, and disease severity, was not significant in current smokers, because of the confounding effect of smoking, on the WBC count.

Conclusion
The WBC count is associated with current smoking status and COPD severity, and a risk factor for poor lung function, and quality of life, especially in non-currently smoking COPD patients. The WBC count can be used, as an easily measurable COPD biomarker.},

The global initiative for obstructive lung disease recommends a fixed ratio between forced expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) of {\textless}0·7 (FR) for the diagnosis of COPD. European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society favour the use of the fifth percentile of the age-related FEV1 /FVC ratio (the lower limit of normal, LLN). The purpose of this study was to analyse extensive lung function tests in groups of subjects fulfilling none, either or both of the spirometric criteria for COPD. From a previous population-based study, 450 subjects were examined with spirometry, body pletysmography diffusing capacity for CO (DL,CO ), Impulse Oscillometry System (IOS) and answered a questionnaire on respiratory symptoms and diseases. Seventy subjects fulfilled both spirometric COPD criteria (FR+LLN+), 62 subjects the fixed ratio criterion (FR+) only. Of the remaining 318 subjects, 236 were ever smokers (N-ES). Significant differences between all groups were seen for FEV1 and DL,CO . Significant differences between groups were also seen for residual volume (RV) and RV/total lung capacity. For IOS, variables and symptoms increasingly abnormal values were seen from never smokers to FR+LLN+. This study shows that subjects meeting both spirometric COPD criteria frequently have symptoms and findings at extended lung function tests compatible with the diagnosis. Also subjects meeting the fixed ratio criterion only tend to have more symptoms and lung function findings compatible with COPD than ever-smoking subjects with FEV1 /VC {\textgreater} 0·7.},

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of airflow limitation with GLI2012 and the degree of underdetection or overestimation related to the use of GOLD in the general population., A Finnish population sample of 1323 subjects (45\% male) with post-bronchodilation spirometry was studied., 80 subjects (6.0\%) and 55 subjects (4.2\%) were identified with airflow limitation with GOLD and GLI2012 criteria, respectively. The proportion of overestimation with GOLD increased with age from 25\% of cases in 50-year-olds to 54\% in 70-year-olds. Using z-score-based grading resulted in more dispersion in severity grading., In conclusion, the GOLD criteria cause a marked overestimation already from 50-year-olds and should be replaced with the GLI2012 criteria to improve diagnostic accuracy., GOLD criteria overestimate COPD, with {\textgreater}30\% of cases having normal spirometry using GLI2012 reference values

	abstract = {PURPOSE The way in which spirometry is interpreted can lead to misdiagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) resulting in inappropriate treatment. We compared the clinical relevance of 2 criteria for defining a low ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC): the fixed ratio and the lower limit of normal.
METHODS We analyzed data from the cross-sectional phase of the population-based Canadian Cohort of Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD) study. We determined associations of the spirometric criteria for airflow limitation with patient-reported adverse outcomes, including respiratory symptoms, disability, health status, exacerbations, and cardiovascular disease. Sensitivity analyses were used to explore the impact of age and severity of airflow limitation on these associations.
RESULTS We analyzed data from 4,882 patients aged 40 years and older. The prevalence of airflow limitation was 17\% by fixed ratio and 11\% by lower limit of normal. Patients classified as having airflow limitation by fixed ratio only had generally small, nonsignificant increases in the odds of adverse outcomes. Patients having airflow limitation based on both fixed ratio and lower limit of normal had larger, significant increases in odds. But strongest associations were seen for patients who had airflow limitation by both fixed ratio and lower limit of normal and also had a low FEV1, defined as one less than 80\% of the predicted value.
CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that use of the fixed ratio alone may lead to misdiagnosis of COPD. A diagnosis established by both a low FEV1/FVC (according to fixed ratio and/or lower limit of normal) and a low FEV1 is strongly associated with clinical outcomes. Guidelines should be reconsidered to require both spirometry abnormalities so as to reduce overdiagnosis of COPD.},

	abstract = {The causal role of obesity in the development of depression remains uncertain. We applied instrumental-variables regression (Mendelian randomization) to examine the association of adolescent and adult body mass index (BMI) with adult depressive symptoms. Participants were from the Young Finns prospective cohort study (n = 1731 persons, 2844 person-observations), with repeated measurements of BMI and depressive symptoms (modified Beck's Depression Inventory). Genetic risk score of 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms previously identified as robust genetic markers of body weight was used as a proxy for variation in BMI. In standard linear regression analysis, higher adult depressive symptoms were predicted by higher adolescent BMI (B = 0.33, CI = 0.06-0.60, P = 0.017) and adult BMI (B = 0.47, CI = 0.32-0.63, P {\textless} 0.001). These associations were replicated in instrumental-variables analysis with genetic risk score as instrument (B = 1.96, CI = 0.03-3.90, P = 0.047 for adolescent BMI; B = 1.08, CI = 0.11-2.04, P = 0.030 for adult BMI). The association for adolescent BMI was significantly stronger in the instrumented analysis compared to standard regression (P = 0.04). These findings provide additional evidence to support a causal role for high BMI in increasing symptoms of depression. However, the present analysis also demonstrates potential limitations of applying Mendelian randomization when using complex phenotypes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adiposity, assessed as elevated body mass index (BMI), is associated with increased risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD); however, whether this is causal is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that positive observational associations between BMI and IHD are causal.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In 75,627 individuals taken from two population-based and one case-control study in Copenhagen, we measured BMI, ascertained 11,056 IHD events, and genotyped FTO(rs9939609), MC4R(rs17782313), and TMEM18(rs6548238). Using genotypes as a combined allele score in instrumental variable analyses, the causal odds ratio (OR) between BMI and IHD was estimated and compared with observational estimates. The allele score-BMI and the allele score-IHD associations used to estimate the causal OR were also calculated individually. In observational analyses the OR for IHD was 1.26 (95\% CI 1.19-1.34) for every 4 kg/m(2) increase in BMI. A one-unit allele score increase associated with a 0.28 kg/m(2) (95 CI\% 0.20-0.36) increase in BMI and an OR for IHD of 1.03 (95\% CI 1.01-1.05) (corresponding to an average 1.68 kg/m(2) BMI increase and 18\% increase in the odds of IHD for those carrying all six BMI increasing alleles). In instrumental variable analysis using the same allele score the causal IHD OR for a 4 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was 1.52 (95\% CI 1.12-2.05).
CONCLUSIONS: For every 4 kg/m(2) increase in BMI, observational estimates suggested a 26\% increase in odds for IHD while causal estimates suggested a 52\% increase. These data add evidence to support a causal link between increased BMI and IHD risk, though the mechanism may ultimately be through intermediate factors like hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. This work has important policy implications for public health, given the continuous nature of the BMI-IHD association and the modifiable nature of BMI. This analysis demonstrates the value of observational studies and their ability to provide unbiased results through inclusion of genetic data avoiding confounding, reverse causation, and bias.},

It is well recognized that under certain conditions, nondifferential measurement error in the exposure variable produces bias towards the null. Measurement error in confounders will lead to residual confounding, but this is not a straightforward issue, and it is not clear in which direction the bias will point. Unmeasured confounders further complicate matters. There has been discussion about the amount of bias in exposure effect estimates that can plausibly occur due to residual or unmeasured confounding. In this paper, the authors use simulation studies and logistic regression analyses to investigate the size of the apparent exposure-outcome association that can occur when in truth the exposure has no causal effect on the outcome. The authors consider two cases with a normally distributed exposure and either two or four normally distributed confounders. When the confounders are uncorrelated, bias in the exposure effect estimate increases as the amount of residual and unmeasured confounding increases. Patterns are more complex for correlated confounders. With plausible assumptions, effect sizes of the magnitude frequently reported in observational epidemiologic studies can be generated by residual and/or unmeasured confounding alone.},

The other main pediatric respiratory diseases, in terms of incidence, are bronchiolitis, acute bronchitis and respiratory infections. Oral corticosteroids, in particular prednisolone, are often used to treat acute respiratory diseases given their anti-inflammatory effects. However, the efficacy of treatment with oral corticosteroids differs among the various types of pediatric respiratory diseases. Notably, also the adverse effects of corticosteroid treatment can differ depending on dosage, duration of treatment and type of corticosteroid administered — a case in point being growth retardation in long-course treatment. A large body of data has accumulated on this topic. In this article, we have reviewed the data and guidelines related to the role of oral corticosteroids in the treatment and management of pediatric bronchiolitis, wheezing, asthma and croup in the attempt to provide guidance for physicians.

	abstract = {Asthma in childhood is a heterogeneous disease with different phenotypes and variable clinical manifestations, which depend on the age, gender, genetic background, and environmental influences of the patients. Several longitudinal studies have been conducted to classify the phenotypes of childhood asthma, on the basis of the symptoms, triggers of wheezing illness, or pathophysiological features of the disease. These studies have provided us with important information about the different wheezing phenotypes in young children and about potential mechanisms and risk factors for the development of chronic asthma. The goal of these studies was to provide a better insight into the causes and natural course of childhood asthma. It is well-known that complicated interactions between genes and environmental factors contribute to the development of asthma. Because childhood is a period of rapid growth in both the lungs and the immune system, developmental factors should be considered in the pathogenesis of childhood asthma. The pulmonary system continues to grow and develop until linear growth is completed. Longitudinal studies have reported significant age-related immune development during postnatal early life. These observations suggest that the phenotypes of childhood asthma vary among children and also in an individual child over time. Improved classification of heterogeneous conditions of the disease will help determine novel strategies for primary and secondary prevention and for the development of individualized treatment for childhood asthma.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unsupervised approaches can be used to analyze complex respiratory and allergic disorders.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the respiratory and allergic phenotypes of children followed in the Pollution and Asthma Risk: An Infant Study (PARIS) birth cohort.
METHODS: Information on respiratory and allergic disorders, medical visits, and medications was collected during medical examinations of children at 18 months of age; biomarker data were also collected (total and allergen-specific IgE levels and eosinophilia). Phenotypes were determined by using latent class analysis. Associated risk factors were determined based on answers to questionnaires about environmental exposures.
RESULTS: Apart from a reference group, which had a low prevalence of respiratory symptoms or allergies (n=1271 [69.4\%]), 3 phenotypes were identified. On the basis of clinical signs of severity and use of health care resources, we identified a mild phenotype (n=306 [16.7\%]) characterized by occasional mild wheeze and 2 severe phenotypes separated by atopic status. The atopic severe phenotype (n=59 [3.2\%]) included 49 (83\%) children with wheezing and was characterized by a high prevalence of atopy (61\% with allergenic sensitization) and atopic dermatitis (78\%). In contrast, atopy was rare among children with the nonatopic severe phenotype (n=195 [11\%]); this group included 88\% of the children with recurrent wheezing. Risk factors for respiratory disease included parental history of asthma, male sex, siblings, day care attendance, exposure to tobacco smoke or molds, indoor renovations, and being overweight, although these factors did not have similar affects on risk for all phenotypes.
CONCLUSION: Atopy should be taken into account when assessing the risk of severe exacerbations (that require hospital-based care) in wheezing infants; precautions should be taken against respiratory irritants and molds and to prevent children from becoming overweight.},

The spectrum of disease ranges from acute infections to chronic non-communicable diseases. Five respiratory conditions dominate-acute respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, tuberculosis (TB), and lung cancer. Pneumonia remains the predominant cause of childhood mortality, causing nearly 1.3 million deaths each year, most of which are preventable. Asthma is the commonest non-communicable disease in children. Pediatric TB constitutes up to 20\% of the TB caseload in high incidence countries. Environmental exposures such as tobacco smoke, indoor air pollution, and poor nutrition are common risk factors for acute and chronic respiratory diseases. Pediatric and adult respiratory disease is closely linked. Early childhood respiratory infection or environmental exposures may lead to chronic disease in adulthood. Childhood immunization can effectively reduce the incidence and severity of childhood pneumonia; childhood immunization is also effective for reducing pneumonia in the elderly. The Forum of International Respiratory Societies (FIRS), representing the major respiratory societies worldwide, has produced a global roadmap of respiratory diseases, Respiratory Disease in the World: Realities of Today-Opportunities for Tomorrow. This highlights the burden of respiratory diseases globally and contains specific recommendations for effective strategies. Greater availability and upscaled implementation of effective strategies for prevention and management of respiratory diseases is needed worldwide to improve global health and diminish the current inequities in health care worldwide.},

	abstract = {Background
Parent of origin effect is important in understanding the genetic basis of childhood allergic diseases and to improve our ability to identify high risk children.

Objective
To investigate parent of origin effect in childhood allergic diseases.

Methods
The Isle of Wight Birth Cohort (n=1,456) has been examined at 1, 2, 4, 10 and 18-years. Information on prevalence of asthma, eczema, rhinitis and environmental factors was obtained using validated questionnaires. Skin prick tests were carried out at ages 4, 10 and 18 year, and total IgE at 10 and 18 years. Parental history of allergic disease was assessed soon after the birth of the child when maternal IgE was also measured. Prevalence ratios (PR) and their 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated, applying log-linear models, adjusted for confounding variables.

Results
When stratified for sex of the child, maternal asthma was associated with asthma in girls [PR:1.91 (CI:1.34–2.72), p=0.0003], but not in boys [PR:1.29 (CI:0.85–1.96), p=0.23), while paternal asthma was associated with asthma in boys [PR:1.99 (CI:1.42–2.79), p{\textless}0.0001], but not in girls [PR: 1.03 (0.59–1.80) p=0.92). Maternal eczema increased the risk of eczema in girls [PR: 1.92 (CI: 1.37–2.68); p=0.0001] only, while paternal eczema did the same for boys (PR: 2.07 (CI:1.32–3.25); P=0.002). Similar trends were observed when the effect of maternal and paternal allergic disease was assessed for childhood atopy and when maternal total IgE was related to total IgE in children at age 10 and 18 years.

Conclusions
The current study indicates a sex dependent association of parental allergic conditions with childhood allergies; maternal allergy increasing the risk in girls and paternal allergy in boys. This has implications for childhood allergy prediction and prevention.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study aims to determine the familial risk of atopic dermatitis (AD) and allergic rhinitis (AR) in Chinese children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a housing estate in Singapore. Data was collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Participants included 257 Chinese families. Prevalence rate ratios (PRRs) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.
RESULTS: For AD in all children, an increasing trend was found with PRRs of 1.9 (95\% CI, 0.3 to 11.8) and 1.5 (95\% CI, 0.4 to 5.5) for only father and only mother affected, respectively, to 2.3 (95\% CI, 0.4 to 13.7) for both parents affected. In AR, a PRR of 2.7 (95\% CI, 1.8 to 3.9) and 2.2 (95\% CI, 1.5 to 3.2) for only father and only mother affected, respectively, and 4.5 (95\% CI, 3.3 to 6.1) for both affected was found. The PRR (2.2; 95\% CI, 1.4 to 3.7) of the first child developing AR when paternal or maternal history was positive was similar. This rose to 3.4 (95\% CI, 2.2 to 5.1) when both parents also had AR. The PRR of the second child developing AR was 3.9 (95\% CI, 1.7 to 8.9) when the first child alone was positive for AR and 7.0 (95\% CI, 3.5 to 13.9) when both parents and the eldest child had AR.
CONCLUSION: A positive family history increases the risk of developing AD and AR with increasing risk dependent on number of relatives affected. The second child's risk of AR is also associated with AR in the first child, suggesting mechanisms of incomplete penetrance.},

The data were collected in a population based cross sectional survey of 9-11 year old schoolchildren living in Munich and southern Bavaria. The relation between asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis and the number of allergic first degree relatives, and the type of allergic disease was examined. Analyses were done separately for families with single or multiple allergic diseases. In families with one allergic parent the risk of the child developing asthma was increased by asthma in a parent, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.6 (95\% confidence interval 1.7 to 4.0) but not by parental allergic rhinitis with OR 1.0 (0.7 to 1.5) or atopic dermatitis, OR 1.0 (0.6 to 1.6). For allergic rhinitis the highest risk with OR 3.6 (2.9 to 4.6) was observed with allergic rhinitis of one parent, apparently lower for asthma of one parent, OR 2.5 (1.6 to 4.0) or atopic dermatitis, OR 1.7 (1.1 to 2.5). Children with parental atopic dermatitis had a high risk for atopic dermatitis, OR 3.4 (2.6 to 4.4), compared with children with parental asthma, OR 1.5 (1.0 to 2.2), or parental allergic rhinitis, OR 1.4 (1.1 to 1.8). Risk factors in families with combined allergies of two relatives (parents and siblings) were analysed separately for the different combinations. These results support the hypothesis that asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis are multifactorial diseases brought about by various familial and environmental influences.},

	abstract = {Objective: Recent studies question whether the risk for psychotic disorder associated with prenatal exposure to infection are due to infections per se, or to shared susceptibility of both infections and psychiatric disorders. Moreover, the potential link between prenatal infection and serious infections during childhood, another alleged risk factor for psychotic disorder, remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of maternal infections during pregnancy in context of parental psychiatric disorders and subsequent childhood infections.  Method: All children born in Sweden 1978–1997 were linked to the National Patient Register. Hazard ratios of nonaffective psychosis were estimated in relation to maternal infection during pregnancy and odds ratios of childhood infection were calculated in relation to maternal infection during pregnancy. Relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) estimated biological synergism between parental psychiatric disorder and maternal infection during pregnancy, and between maternal infection during pregnancy and childhood infection.  Results: Maternal infection during pregnancy was not statistically significantly associated with offspring psychosis (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.06, 95\% CI 0.88–1.27). However, maternal infection during pregnancy and maternal psychiatric disorders acted synergistically in offspring psychosis development (RERI 1.33, 95\% CI 0.27–2.38). Maternal infection during pregnancy increased the risk of offspring childhood infections (OR 1.50, 95\% CI 1.45–1.54). These 2 factors also interacted in psychosis development (RERI 0.63, 95\% CI 0.12–1.14).  Conclusions: Among mothers with a history of psychiatric disease, infection during pregnancy increases the risk of psychosis in offspring. Maternal infections during pregnancy appear to contribute to the risk of childhood infections, which together render the child more vulnerable to psychosis development.},

Mothers with asthma (n = 2193) were compared with a randomly selected control sample (n = 8772) from the remaining population of mothers.
RESULTS: After important confounding variables were accounted for, maternal asthma was significantly associated with several adverse infant outcomes, including preterm birth and birth of infants who are very small for gestational age, and adverse maternal outcomes, such as idiopathic preterm labor, early idiopathic preterm labor, preeclampsia, transient hypertension of pregnancy, pregnancy-associated hypertension, chorioamnionitis, and cesarean delivery.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies of exposure to pets and the risk of asthma have provided conflicting results.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a population-based incident case-control study to assess the relationship of current and previous pet keeping with the risk of adult-onset asthma. We also investigated whether genetic propensity as a result of parental atopy modifies these relations.
METHODS: From the source population of 441,000 inhabitants of a geographically defined area in South Finland, we systematically recruited, during a 2.5-year period, all new cases of asthma in 21- to 63-year-old adults and randomly selected control subjects. The clinically diagnosed case series consisted of 521 adults with newly diagnosed asthma and a control series of 932 control subjects. Information on current and past exposure to hairy pets was collected by using a self-administered questionnaire.
RESULTS: In logistic regression analysis the risk of asthma was lower among subjects with pets during the past 12 months (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.74; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.96) but higher among subjects with pets more than 12 months previously (adjusted OR, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.84). Parental atopy increased the risk of asthma (OR, 1.88; 95\% CI, 1.47-2.41), but there was no interaction between parental atopy and pet exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: The present results are consistent with the hypothesis that both keeping furry pets and parental atopy increase the risk of asthma development in adulthood. Parental atopy does not modify the effects of pet exposure. The negative association between current pets and the risk of asthma is consistent with selective avoidance of these pets by symptomatic individuals.},

Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a history of asthma in a 7-year-old was associated with the child being male (odds ratio [OR] 1.56; 99\% confidence interval 1.30–1.86), having a history of hay fever (3.86; 3.12–4.78), eczema (2.04; 1.63–2.55), hives (1.34; 1.09–1.65) or allergy to foods or medicines (1.70; 1.26–2.30), the child's mother or father having a history of asthma (2.63; 2.08–3.31 or 2.52; 1.99–3.19, respectively), and the mother being a smoker (1.26; 1.05–1.51). Parental hay fever and paternal smoking were not independently associated with childhood asthma. The strength of association between childhood asthma and parental asthma was independent of the sex of either the parent or the child, and of atopic conditions in the child. In the 133 children for whom both parents were asthmatic, 65 (49\%) had a history of asthma. These findings, based on a population survey, are consistent, not only with a childhood history of asthma being strongly associated with atopy, but also with the existence of strong unmeasured determinants common to family members, the effects of which are not mediated via atopy. The risk for asthma being independent of both the sex of the child and of the parent, is consistent with a genetic aetiology for susceptibility to asthma.},

	abstract = {Objective This study examined the association between child day care and the utilization of health care resources. It also investigated whether increased use of health care resources in day-care children is due to acute diarrheal illness or upper respiratory tract infections (URI). Sample Study subjects were recruited as day-care children (n = 435) and home-care children (n = 753) through a health maintenance organization (HMO) and a consortium of Medicaid providers in Columbia, South Carolina, and were followed bimonthly for 18 months. Method A survey was conducted to collect data on children aged 5 years or younger from their parents. The questionnaires collected familial information, individual characteristics, disease-related symptoms, and the information on physician visits, antibiotic use, and use of other medicines. The association between day care attendance and the likelihood of using health care resources was examined by multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results Compared with home-care children, the odds ratios for physician visits, use of antibiotics, and use of other medicines were all significantly greater for children attending day care. However, the increased likelihood of physician visits in day-care children may not be attributable to diarrheal illness or URI. Conclusions Day care attendance is associated with the increased use of health care. Antibiotics are more likely to be prescribed in day-care children than in home-care children for diarrheal illness and URI. Implications for practice Understanding the association between child day care attendance and utilization of health care resources will assist health care providers in evaluating their practice in providing medical care to children.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Opportunities to improve health care quality and contain spending may differ between high and low resource users. This study’s objectives were to assess health care and spending among children with Medicaid insurance by their resource use.

METHODS:
Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 2012 Medicaid health administrative data from 10 states of children ages 11 months to 18 years. Subjects were categorized into 4 spending groups, each representing ∼25\% of total spending: the least expensive 80\% of children (n = 2 868 267), the next 15\% expensive (n = 537 800), the next 4\% expensive (n = 143 413), and the top 1\% (n = 35 853). We compared per-member-per-month (PMPM) spending across the groups using the Kruskal–Wallis test.

RESULTS:
PMPM spending was \$68 (least expensive 80\%), \$349 (next 15\%), \$1200 (next 4\%), and \$6738 (top 1\%). Between the least and most expensive groups, percentages of total spending were higher for inpatient ({\textless}1\% vs 46\%) and mental health (7\% vs 24\%) but lower for emergency (15\% vs 1\%) and primary (23\% vs 1\%) care (all Ps {\textless} .001). From the least to most expensive groups, increases in PMPM spending were smallest for primary care (from \$15 to \$33) and much larger for inpatient (\$0.28 to \$3129), mental health (\$4 to \$1609), specialty care (\$8 to \$768), and pharmacy (\$4 to \$699).

CONCLUSIONS:
As resource use increases in children with Medicaid, spending rises unevenly across health services: Spending on primary care rises modestly compared with other health services. Future studies should assess whether more spending on primary care leads to better quality and cost containment for high resource users.},

A stratified random sample of 713 children was selected from respondents to a postal respiratory questionnaire, carried out in two general practice populations in 1993. Children were stratified into four groups according to the number of positive responses to five key questions. These groups were used as indicators of likelihood of asthma diagnosis. A search was made of these childrens' practice records covering a 2-yr period, to include both primary and secondary healthcare. There was a significant increase across positive response groups in the proportion of children having primary and secondary care based consultations, particularly for respiratory conditions (p = 0.001). There was also a significant increase in prescribing. Of those children considered to be "likely asthmatics" from their questionnaire responses, 8.1\% (n = 31) did not receive any primary or secondary care for a respiratory problem over the 2-yr period. As the likelihood of respiratory illness increased in this population, more demand was made upon resources for the treatment of respiratory illness. Quantification of this demand enables evidence based resource allocation decisions to be made. This method of quantification could be applied in other populations.},

	abstract = {Children with asthma use significantly more health services than other children, yet the majority of their health care costs are for nonasthma services. The objective of this study was to measure the impact of asthma and specific upper respiratory comorbidities on the use and cost of health care by children. A population-based historical cohort study from January 1, 1992 to December 31, 1992 was conducted. Multiple visits for otitis media, sinusitis, and allergic rhinitis were considered comorbidities. The outcome measures were nonurgent outpatient care, pharmacy fills, urgent care visits, and hospital care along with the associated total costs. Children between ages 1 and 17 years were studied (n = 71,818). Children with asthma were more likely than children without asthma to have a comorbidity (26\% vs. 9\%). Children with multiple visits for otitis media, sinusitis, and allergic rhinitis were 1.8, 4, and 12 times more likely, respectively, to have a diagnosis of asthma in the same year. Children with asthma had a 47\% probability of being in the highest total cost quintile compared to a 29\% likelihood once adjusted for comorbidities. Visits for otitis media, sinusitis, and particularly allergic rhinitis appear to be overrepresented in children with asthma and contribute to their high utilization rate. Once a high-risk cohort is identified, the needs of those children can be addressed through targeted, organized systems of care that may include guidelines or other disease management strategies.},

	abstract = {Multiple outcomes, both continuous and discrete, are routinely gathered on subjects in longitudinal studies and during routine clinical follow-up in general. To motivate our work, we consider a longitudinal study on patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with a continuous bilirubin level, a discrete platelet count and a dichotomous indication of blood vessel malformations as examples of such longitudinal outcomes. An apparent requirement is to use all the outcome values to classify the subjects into groups (e.g., groups of subjects with a similar prognosis in a clinical setting). In recent years, numerous approaches have been suggested for classification based on longitudinal (or otherwise correlated) outcomes, targeting not only traditional areas like biostatistics, but also rapidly evolving bioinformatics and many others. However, most available approaches consider only continuous outcomes as a basis for classification, or if noncontinuous outcomes are considered, then not in combination with other outcomes of a different nature. Here, we propose a statistical method for clustering (classification) of subjects into a prespecified number of groups with a priori unknown characteristics on the basis of repeated measurements of several longitudinal outcomes of a different nature. This method relies on a multivariate extension of the classical generalized linear mixed model where a mixture distribution is additionally assumed for random effects. We base the inference on a Bayesian specification of the model and simulation-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology. To apply the method in practice, we have prepared ready-to-use software for use in R (http://www.R-project.org). We also discuss evaluation of uncertainty in the classification and also discuss usage of a recently proposed methodology for model comparison—the selection of a number of clusters in our case—based on the penalized posterior deviance proposed by Plummer [Biostatistics 9 (2008) 523–539].},

	abstract = {Objectives
Children with medical complexity (CMC) have multiple specialty need, technology dependence, and high health care utilization. The objective of this study is to profile types of pediatric health care utilization and costs by increasing levels of medical complexity.

Methods
Cross-sectional study of the 2007, 2008 and 2009 Full-Year Data Sets from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Medical complexity was defined by a higher number of positive items from the five question Children with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN) Screener. CMC were defined by ≥4 positive screener items. Outcomes included the number of inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department visits, associated costs and diagnoses, and reported satisfaction. ICD-9 codes were grouped by Clinical Classifications Software.

Results
Of 27,755 total study subjects ≤17 years, 4,851 had special needs and 541 were CMC. Older age, male gender, white/non-Hispanic race/ethnicity, and public insurance were all associated with medical complexity (all p{\textless}.001). CMC had an annual mean of 19 annual outpatient visits (\$616) and 0.26 inpatient visits (\$3,308), with other significant cost drivers including home health (\$2,957) and prescriptions (\$2,182). The most common reasons for non-CSHCN and less-complex CSHCN outpatient visits were viral illnesses, while the main reasons for CMC visits were for mental health. Compared to families without CSHCN, those with CMC have, on average, lower satisfaction with health care (8.4 versus 8.9 out of 10, p{\textless}.001).

Conclusion
Health care models for CMC should account for mental health conditions that may be driving high numbers of outpatient encounters.},

Health care use of children with medical complexity (CMC), such as those with neurologic impairment or other complex chronic conditions (CCCs) and those with technology assistance (TA), is not well understood. The objective of the study was to evaluate health care utilization and costs in a population-based sample of CMC in Ontario, Canada.

METHODS:
Hospital discharge data from 2005 through 2007 identified CMC. Complete health system use and costs were analyzed over the subsequent 2-year period.

RESULTS:
The study identified 15 771 hospitalized CMC (0.67\% of children in Ontario); 10 340 (65.6\%) had single-organ CCC, 1063 (6.7\%) multiorgan CCC, 4368 (27.6\%) neurologic impairment, and 1863 (11.8\%) had TA. CMC saw a median of 13 outpatient physicians and 6 distinct subspecialists. Thirty-six percent received home care services. Thirty-day readmission varied from 12.6\% (single CCC without TA) to 23.7\% (multiple CCC with TA). CMC accounted for almost one-third of child health spending. Rehospitalization accounted for the largest proportion of subsequent costs (27.2\%), followed by home care (11.3\%) and physician services (6.0\%). Home care costs were a much larger proportion of costs in children with TA. Children with multiple CCC with TA had costs 3.5 times higher than children with a single CCC without TA.

CONCLUSIONS:
Although a small proportion of the population, CMC account for a substantial proportion of health care costs. CMC make multiple transitions across providers and care settings and CMC with TA have higher costs and home care use. Initiatives to improve their health outcomes and decrease costs need to focus on the entire continuum of care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Children who experience high health care costs are increasingly enrolled in clinical initiatives to improve their health and contain costs. Hospitalization is a significant cost driver. We describe hospitalization trends for children with highest annual inpatient cost (CHIC) and identify characteristics associated with persistently high inpatient costs in subsequent years.
METHODS: Retrospective study of 265 869 children age 2 to 15 years with ≥1 admission in 2010 to 39 children's hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System. CHIC were defined as the top 10\% of total inpatient costs in 2010 (n = 26 574). Multivariate regression and regression tree modeling were used to distinguish individual characteristics and interactions of characteristics, respectively, associated with persistently high inpatient costs (≥80th percentile in 2011 and/or 2012).
RESULTS: The top 10\% most expensive children (CHIC) constituted 56.9\% (\$2.4 billion) of total inpatient costs in 2010. Fifty-eight percent (n = 15 391) of CHIC had no inpatient costs in 2011 to 2012, and 27.0\% (n = 7180) experienced persistently high inpatient cost. Respiratory chronic conditions (odds ratio [OR] = 3.0; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-3.5), absence of surgery in 2010 (OR = 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.8-2.1), and technological assistance (OR = 1.6; 95\% CI, 1.5-1.7) were associated with persistently high inpatient cost. In regression tree modeling, the greatest likelihood of persistence (65.3\%) was observed in CHIC with ≥3 hospitalizations in 2010 and a chronic respiratory condition.
CONCLUSIONS: Most children with high children's hospital inpatient costs in 1 year do not experience hospitalization in subsequent years. Interactions of hospital use and clinical characteristics may be helpful to determine which children will continue to experience high inpatient costs over time.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known about factors associated with lung function decline in asthma.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the determinants of FEV(1) decline in adults with asthma with and without airflow obstruction at baseline.
METHODS: An international cohort of 638 subjects with asthma (20-44 years old) was identified in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (1991-1993) and followed up from 1998 to 2002. Spirometry was performed on both occasions. FEV(1) decline was related to potential determinants evaluated at baseline and during the follow-up by random intercept linear regression models. The analyses were stratified by the presence of airflow obstruction (FEV(1)/forced vital capacity {\textless} 0.70) at baseline.
RESULTS: In the group of individuals without airflow obstruction (n = 544), a faster FEV(1) decline was observed for subjects with intermediate body mass index (BMI) than for lean and obese subjects. FEV(1) decline was associated with weight gain independently of baseline BMI, and this association was stronger in men (20; 95\% CI, 10-30, mL/y/kg gained) than in women (6; 95\% CI, 1-11, mL/y). In the group of individuals with airflow obstruction (n = 94), the absence of allergen sensitization and a low BMI at baseline were associated with a faster FEV(1) decline, whereas weight gain was not associated with decline.
CONCLUSIONS: The detrimental effect of weight gain on FEV(1) decline is particularly relevant in subjects with asthma who still do not have an established airflow obstruction. Our findings support the importance of weight management in asthma and recommend weight loss in overweight or obese individuals with asthma.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of the progressive increase in body weight on lung function by oxygen peripheral saturation, spirometry and maximal respiratory pressures in different degrees of obesity.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study including 140 patients in clinical and surgical evaluation for obesity treatment. The selected patients were divided into six groups of body mass index (BMI), including a control group of non-obese and a subdivision for the morbidly obese into three subgroups.
RESULTS: Significant differences were demonstrated between the groups regarding oxygen peripheral saturation (SpO2) (p {\textless} 0.001), forced vital capacity (FVC) (p {\textless} 0.002, p {\textless} 0.02) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (p {\textless} 0.001, p {\textless} 0.03) in relative and absolute values, respectively. Group VI (BMI {\textgreater} 50.9 kg/m²) showed significant differences (SpO2, FVC and FEV1) when compared with the other groups (except group V) and group V (BMI {\textgreater} 45 to 49.9 kg/m²) with the group control. The other variables (FEV1/FVC ratio, forced expiratory flow 25-75 [FEF25-75] and maximal respiratory pressure) did not show any statistical differences.
CONCLUSION: Lung function is influenced by the progressive increase in BMI, with changes in lung function better demonstrated when BMI {\textgreater} 45 kg/m²; these changes are more evident when BMI {\textgreater} 50.9 kg/m².},

Many studies have been published about the correlation between asthma and obesity in males and females. Various epidemiological data showed that obesity precedes development of asthma and increases the prevalence and incidence of asthma, indicates the possibility of a causal association.

Aim:
To find out the correlation between body mass index and lung functions parameters in non-asthmatics, diagnosed by spirometric values in males and females.

Methods:
A retrospective study was conducted from October, 2012 to March, 2013 in Physiology department, R.G.Kar Medical College, Kolkata, India on the spirometric data stored in our laboratory. About 590 test results were reviewed, among them only 424 test results of non asthmatics were analysed for our study.

Results:
Comparison of lung function parameters between male and female showed a significant difference. Lung function parameters like Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV), Forced Expiratory Flow (FEF) rates, were significantly correlated with BMI among the obese subjects [FEV1(r=-0.531, p=0.009); FEF25-75\% (r=-0.653, p=0.001); FEV1/FVC (r=-0.603, p=0.002)]. Significant association was found between BMI and lung function parameters in obese female but not in obese male.

Conclusion:
Association was found between indices of spirometry and BMI in non-asthmatic obese group along with a gender disparity.},

	volume = {34},
	issn = {0954-7894},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory infiltrates, airway hyper-responsiveness, goblet cell hyperplasia and subepithelial thickening are characteristic of chronic asthma. Current animal models of allergen-induced airway inflammation generally concentrate on the acute inflammation following allergen exposure and fail to mimic all of these features.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use a murine model of prolonged allergen-induced airway inflammation in order to characterize the cells and molecules involved in the ensuing airway remodelling. Moreover, we investigated whether remodelling persists in the absence of continued allergen challenge.
METHODS: Acute pulmonary eosinophilia and airways hyper-reactivity were induced after six serial allergen challenges in sensitized mice (acute phase). Mice were subsequently challenged three times a week with ovalbumin (OVA) (chronic phase) up to day 55. To investigate the persistence of pathology, one group of mice were left for another 4 weeks without further allergen challenge (day 80).
RESULTS: The extended OVA challenge protocol caused significant airway remodelling, which was absent in the acute phase. Specifically, remodelling was characterized by deposition of collagen as well as airway smooth muscle and goblet cell hyperplasia. Importantly, these airway changes, together with tissue eosinophilia were sustained in the absence of further allergen challenge. Examination of cytokines revealed a dramatic up-regulation of IL-4 and tumour growth factor-beta1 during the chronic phase. Interestingly, while IL-4 levels were significantly increased during the chronic phase, levels of IL-13 fell. Levels of the Th1-associated cytokine IFN-gamma also increased during the chronic phase.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we have demonstrated that prolonged allergen challenge results in persistent airway wall remodelling.},

To investigate responses to continuous antigen exposure, mice were exposed to either house dust mite extract (HDM) or ovalbumin intranasally for five consecutive days, followed by 2 days of rest, for up to seven consecutive weeks. Continuous exposure to HDM, unlike ovalbumin, elicited severe and persistent eosinophilic airway inflammation. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated an accumulation of CD4+ lymphocytes in the lung with elevated expression of inducible costimulator a marker of T cell activation, and of T1/ST2, a marker of helper T Type 2 effector cells. We also detected increased and sustained production of helper T cell Type 2-associated cytokines by splenocytes of HDM-exposed mice on in vitro HDM recall. Histologic analysis of the lung showed evidence of airway remodeling in mice exposed to HDM, with goblet cell hyperplasia, collagen deposition, and peribronchial accumulation of contractile tissue. In addition, HDM-exposed mice demonstrated severe airway hyperreactivity to methacholine. Finally, these responses were studied for up to 9 weeks after cessation of HDM exposure. We observed that whereas airway inflammation resolved fully, the remodeling changes did not resolve and airway hyperreactivity resolved only partly.},

Developing community systems of services for children with special health care needs represents a significant challenge for pediatricians, families, managed care organizations, and public and private agencies providing services to this population. At the state level, Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and Children With Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN) programs are vested with the responsibility for planning and developing systems of care for all children with special health care needs. Historically, these programs have been supported through Title V of the Social Security Act, with state-matching funds, to provide health services to selected groups of children with special needs, typically those with complex physical conditions. However, during the last half-century, service systems have become increasingly complex as a result of health, education, and social policy changes, as well as changes in the epidemiology of child health, including increases in the number and proportion of children with chronic conditions and disabilities and changes in their case-mix.1-4 These changes have resulted in gaps in some service areas and duplication in other areas, as well as fragmentation in the way service systems are organized.5 

Recognizing these difficulties, health policy leaders at the state and federal levels, with broad input from public and private agencies, providers, and families, effected legislative changes in the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, which expanded the mission of CSHCN programs to facilitate the development of community-based systems of services for children with special health care needs and their families. Since then, the explosive growth of managed care has presented new challenges and opportunities as well as a heightened urgency for the development of systems of care that integrate health and related services for this population.6 7 

Developing systems to serve children with special health care needs requires a clear definition of the population to …

A relationship between COPD and obesity is increasingly recognised, although the nature of this association remains unknown. This review focuses on the epidemiology of obesity in COPD and the impact of excessive fat mass on lung function, exercise capacity and prognosis. The evidence for altered adipose tissue functions in obesity—including reduced lipid storage capacity, altered expression and secretion of inflammatory factors, adipose tissue hypoxia and macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue—is also reviewed. The interrelationship between these factors and their contribution to the development of insulin resistance in obesity is considered. It is proposed that, in patients with COPD, reduced oxidative capacity and systemic hypoxia may amplify these disturbances, not only in obese patients but also in subjects with hidden loss of fat-free mass. The potential interaction between abnormal adipose tissue function, systemic inflammation and COPD may provide more insight into the pathogenesis and reversibility of systemic pathology in this disease.},

Methods: A pooled analysis, based on intention to treat, of individual patient data from seven randomised trials (involving 5085 patients) was performed in which the effects of inhaled corticosteroids and placebo were compared over at least 12 months in patients with stable COPD. The end point was all-cause mortality.
Results: Overall, 4\% of the participants died during a mean follow up period of 26 months. Inhaled corticosteroids reduced all-cause mortality by about 25\% relative to placebo. Stratification by individual trials and adjustments for age, sex, baseline post-bronchodilator percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second, smoking status, and body mass index did not materially change the results (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.73; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.96). Although there was considerable overlap between subgroups in terms of effect sizes, the beneficial effect was especially noticeable in women (adjusted HR 0.46; 95\% CI 0.24 to 0.91) and former smokers (adjusted HR 0.60; 95\% CI 0.39 to 0.93).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies have shown that body mass index (BMI) is positively associated with asthma. However, observational data are prone to confounding and reverse causation. In Mendelian randomization, genetic variants are used as unconfounded markers of exposures to examine causal effects. We examined the causal effect of BMI on asthma, hay fever, allergic sensitization, serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE), forced expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC).
METHODS: We included 490 497 participants in the observational and 162 124 participants in the genetic analyses. A genetic risk score (GRS) was created using 26 BMI-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Results were pooled in meta-analyses and expressed as odds ratios (ORs) or β-estimates with 95\% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: The GRS was significantly associated with asthma (OR=1.009; 95\% CI: 1.004, 1.013), but not with hay fever (OR= 0.998; 95\% CI: 0.994, 1.002) or allergic sensitization (OR=0.999; 95\% CI: 0.986, 1.012) per BMI-increasing allele. The GRS was significantly associated with decrease in FEV1: β=-0.0012 (95\% CI: -0.0019, -0.0006) and FVC: β=-0.0022 (95\% CI: -0.0031, -0.0014) per BMI-increasing allele. Effect sizes estimated by instrumental variable analyses were OR=1.07 (95\% CI: 1.03, 1.10) for asthma, a 9 ml decrease in FEV1 (95\% CI: 2.0-15 mL decrease) and a 16 ml decrease in FVC (95\% CI: 7.0-24 mL decrease) per 1 kg/m2 higher BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: The results support the conclusion that increasing BMI is causally related to higher prevalence of asthma and decreased lung function, but not with hay fever or biomarkers of allergy.},

	abstract = {Background
This study aims to assess the relationship of body mass index (BMI) status with respiratory conditions, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a state population.

Methods
Self-reported data from 11,868 adults aged ≥18 years in the 2012 South Carolina Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System telephone survey were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression that accounted for the complex sampling design and adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, physical inactivity, and cancer history.

Results
The distribution of BMI (kg/m2) was 1.5\% for underweight ({\textless}18.5), 32.3\% for normal weight (18.5-24.9), 34.6\% for overweight (25.0-29.9), 26.5\% for obese (30.0-39.9), and 5.1\% for morbidly obese (≥40.0). Among respondents, 10.0\% had frequent productive cough, 4.3\% had frequent shortness of breath (SOB), 7.3\% strongly agreed that SOB affected physical activity, 8.4\% had current asthma, and 7.4\% had COPD. Adults at extremes of body weight were more likely to report having asthma or COPD, and to report respiratory conditions. Age-adjusted U-shaped relationships of BMI categories with current asthma and strongly agreeing that SOB affected physical activity, but not U-shaped relationship with COPD, persisted after controlling for the covariates (p{\textless}0.001). Morbidly obese but not underweight or obese respondents were significantly more likely to have frequent productive cough and frequent SOB than normal weight adults after adjustment.

Conclusion
Our data confirm that both underweight and obesity are associated with current asthma and obesity with COPD. Increased emphasis on exercise and nutrition may improve respiratory conditions.},

A random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled relative risks (RRs) of all-cause mortality in COPD patients with normal weight compared with those who were underweight, overweight, or obese. In addition, a dose–response meta-analysis was conducted to explore the dose–response relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality in COPD patients., A total of 17 observational studies involving 30,182 COPD patients among 285,960 participants were included. Compared with the reference category, the RRs of underweight, overweight, and obese individuals were 1.40 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.20–1.63), 0.80 (95\% CI, 0.67–0.96), and 0.77 (95\% CI, 0.62–0.95), respectively. A significant nonlinear relationship between BMI and mortality of COPD patients was found by using a random effects model. COPD patients with BMI of {\textless}21.75 kg/m2 had a higher risk of death. Moreover, an increase in the BMI resulted in a decrease in the risk of death. The risk of death was lowest when BMI was 30 kg/m2 (RR = 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.53–0.89). The BMI was not associated with all-cause mortality when BMI was {\textgreater}32 kg/m2., Our findings indicate that overweight is associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality among patients with COPD whereas underweight is associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality in these patients. However, there is limited evidence to support the association between obesity and the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with COPD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The main associations of body-mass index (BMI) with overall and cause-specific mortality can best be assessed by long-term prospective follow-up of large numbers of people. The Prospective Studies Collaboration aimed to investigate these associations by sharing data from many studies.
METHODS: Collaborative analyses were undertaken of baseline BMI versus mortality in 57 prospective studies with 894 576 participants, mostly in western Europe and North America (61\% [n=541 452] male, mean recruitment age 46 [SD 11] years, median recruitment year 1979 [IQR 1975-85], mean BMI 25 [SD 4] kg/m(2)). The analyses were adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and study. To limit reverse causality, the first 5 years of follow-up were excluded, leaving 66 552 deaths of known cause during a mean of 8 (SD 6) further years of follow-up (mean age at death 67 [SD 10] years): 30 416 vascular; 2070 diabetic, renal or hepatic; 22 592 neoplastic; 3770 respiratory; 7704 other.
FINDINGS: In both sexes, mortality was lowest at about 22.5-25 kg/m(2). Above this range, positive associations were recorded for several specific causes and inverse associations for none, the absolute excess risks for higher BMI and smoking were roughly additive, and each 5 kg/m(2) higher BMI was on average associated with about 30\% higher overall mortality (hazard ratio per 5 kg/m(2) [HR] 1.29 [95\% CI 1.27-1.32]): 40\% for vascular mortality (HR 1.41 [1.37-1.45]); 60-120\% for diabetic, renal, and hepatic mortality (HRs 2.16 [1.89-2.46], 1.59 [1.27-1.99], and 1.82 [1.59-2.09], respectively); 10\% for neoplastic mortality (HR 1.10 [1.06-1.15]); and 20\% for respiratory and for all other mortality (HRs 1.20 [1.07-1.34] and 1.20 [1.16-1.25], respectively). Below the range 22.5-25 kg/m(2), BMI was associated inversely with overall mortality, mainly because of strong inverse associations with respiratory disease and lung cancer. These inverse associations were much stronger for smokers than for non-smokers, despite cigarette consumption per smoker varying little with BMI.
INTERPRETATION: Although other anthropometric measures (eg, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio) could well add extra information to BMI, and BMI to them, BMI is in itself a strong predictor of overall mortality both above and below the apparent optimum of about 22.5-25 kg/m(2). The progressive excess mortality above this range is due mainly to vascular disease and is probably largely causal. At 30-35 kg/m(2), median survival is reduced by 2-4 years; at 40-45 kg/m(2), it is reduced by 8-10 years (which is comparable with the effects of smoking). The definite excess mortality below 22.5 kg/m(2) is due mainly to smoking-related diseases, and is not fully explained.},

	abstract = {Background The aim of this study was to estimate the long-term (cost-) effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Methods A systematic review was performed of randomised controlled trials on smoking cessation interventions in patients with COPD reporting 12-month biochemical validated abstinence rates. The different interventions were grouped into four categories: usual care, minimal counselling, intensive counselling and intensive counselling + pharmacotherapy (‘pharmacotherapy’). For each category the average 12-month continuous abstinence rate and intervention costs were estimated. A dynamic population model for COPD was used to project the long-term (cost-) effectiveness (25 years) of 1-year implementation of the interventions for 50\% of the patients with COPD who smoked compared with usual care. Uncertainty and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed for variations in the calculation of the abstinence rates, the type of projection, intervention costs and discount rates.
Results Nine studies were selected. The average 12-month continuous abstinence rates were estimated to be 1.4\% for usual care, 2.6\% for minimal counselling, 6.0\% for intensive counselling and 12.3\% for pharmacotherapy. Compared with usual care, the costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for minimal counselling, intensive counselling and pharmacotherapy were €16 900, €8200 and €2400, respectively. The results were most sensitive to variations in the estimation of the abstinence rates and discount rates.
Conclusion Compared with usual care, intensive counselling and pharmacotherapy resulted in low costs per QALY gained with ratios comparable to results for smoking cessation in the general population. Compared with intensive counselling, pharmacotherapy was cost saving and dominated the other interventions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a program incorporating smoking intervention and use of an inhaled bronchodilator can slow the rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in smokers aged 35 to 60 years who have mild obstructive pulmonary disease.
DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. Participants randomized with equal probability to one of the following groups: (1) smoking intervention plus bronchodilator, (2) smoking intervention plus placebo, or (3) no intervention.
SETTING: Ten clinical centers in the United States and Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5887 male and female smokers, aged 35 to 60 years, with spirometric signs of early chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
INTERVENTIONS: Smoking intervention: intensive 12-session smoking cessation program combining behavior modification and use of nicotine gum, with continuing 5-year maintenance program to minimize relapse. Bronchodilator: ipratropium bromide prescribed three times daily (two puffs per time) from a metered-dose inhaler.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of change and cumulative change in FEV1 over a 5-year period.
RESULTS: Participants in the two smoking intervention groups showed significantly smaller declines in FEV1 than did those in the control group. Most of this difference occurred during the first year following entry into the study and was attributable to smoking cessation, with those who achieved sustained smoking cessation experiencing the largest benefit. The small noncumulative benefit associated with use of the active bronchodilator vanished after the bronchodilator was discontinued at the end of the study.
CONCLUSIONS: An aggressive smoking intervention program significantly reduces the age-related decline in FEV1 in middle-aged smokers with mild airways obstruction. Use of an inhaled anticholinergic bronchodilator results in a relatively small improvement in FEV1 that appears to be reversed after the drug is discontinued. Use of the bronchodilator did not influence the long-term decline of FEV1.},

Methods: Study was based on data from the Health Survey of the population of Serbia, 2013. A stratified two-stage sample of the population was used. Respondents with self-reported history of chronic bronchitis/emphysema were analyzed, total of 641.
Results: Analysis showed that 3.0\% were underweight, 29.7\% were with normal weight, 34.9\% were in BMI category 25-29.9, and 32.5\% were obese
The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension, arthrosis, anxiety/depression and diabetes (56.3\%, 27.3\%, 21.5\% and 18.4\%, respectively). In underweight, second most prevalent comorbidity was anxiety/depression (36.8\%), and in obese, diabetes was third most prevalent comorbidity (27.2\%). The highest number of comorbidities was present in the BMI category {\textgreater}30 (84.0\%). The highest percentage of respondents with only one comorbid illness was in underweight respondents (52.6\%). The highest percentage of respondents with 2, and 3 or more comorbid illness was in obese (29.1\% and 21.8\%, respectively).
Multiple logistic regression showed that being in higher BMI category increases risk of comorbidites by almost 40\%.

In total, 163 patients with COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage I–IV; BODE (body mass index, airway obstruction, dyspnoea, exercise capacity) index score 0–10) and 29 patients with chronic bronchitis (normal spirometry; former GOLD stage 0) wore activity monitors that recorded steps per day, minutes of at least moderate activity, and physical activity levels for 5 days (3 weekdays plus Saturday and Sunday).
Compared with patients with chronic bronchitis, steps per day, minutes of at least moderate activity and physical activity levels were reduced from GOLD stage II/BODE score 1, GOLD stage III/BODE score 3/4 and from GOLD stage III/BODE score 1, respectively. Reliability of physical activity measurements improved with the number of measured days and with higher GOLD stages. Moderate relationships were observed between clinical characteristics and physical activity. GOLD stages III and IV best predicted very inactive patients.

Therefore, four groups of subjects matched for weight, height, and body mass index (n = 119; 60 women, 59 men), but differing in age (above and below 50 y) and sex were investigated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess body composition (bone, lean, and fat mass as well as its distribution) and indirect calorimetry to determine resting fuel metabolism. Fat mass of trunk and arms (P {\textless} 0.01), but not legs, increased with advancing age in males, resulting in a continuous increase in the ratio of upper- to lower-body fat (r = 0.45, P {\textless} 0.001). In contrast, total fat mass remained stable in women, irrespective of menopause, but a redistribution of fat occurred with advancing age (r = 0.43, P {\textless} 0.001), resulting in a higher upper- to lower-body fat ratio (P {\textless} 0.05) in older than in younger women. Total lean soft-tissue mass of all segments of the body was greater in men than in women irrespective of age (P {\textless} 0.001), and lower in the older groups than in the younger ones irrespective of sex. In males, but not females, lean soft-tissue mass in arms and legs decreased (r = 0.57, P {\textless} 0.001), whereas the ratio of total fat to lean soft-tissue mass increased (r = 0.53, P {\textless} 0.001) with age. Bone mineral content correlated with total body fat in both groups of women and in young males (r {\textgreater} 0.5, P {\textless} 0.001), but not in older males. With advancing age, the proportion of lean soft-tissue mass occupied by total skeleton declined in women (n = 59, P {\textless} 0.001), but remained stable in males. Resting energy expenditure decreased with age in both sexes. Protein and carbohydrate oxidation were similar in all four groups of subjects. Total fat oxidation and fat oxidation per kilogram of lean soft-tissue mass decreased with age (r {\textgreater} 0.36, P {\textless} 0.01) in males, but not in females, whereas it increased with increasing fat mass in females (r {\textgreater} 0.32, P {\textless} 0.03), but not in males. In contrast, fat oxidation per kilogram of fat mass decreased with fat mass in males (r = 0.61, P {\textless} 0.001), but not in females. Our results suggest that aging affects body composition and fuel metabolism differently in each gender, leading to reduced fat oxidation and accumulation of upper-body fat with loss of striated muscle in men, and to an increased ratio of upper- to lower-body fat and bone loss in women, the latter depending on fat mass.},

We stained the biopsies for myosin ATPase and measured the proportions and diameters of the type 1 and type 2 fibers. There were more qualitative changes in the external intercostal muscles than in the other two, and some of these changes related to the incidence of malignancy. There were more type 1 fibers in the external intercostal (64 ± 10 percent) and internal intercostal muscles (59 ± 12 percent) than in the latissimus dorsi (44 ± 13 percent) (p{\textless}0.005). The mean diameter of the type 2 fibers in the external intercostal muscles was less (44μ ± 7μ) than the diameter in the latissimus dorsi (51μ ± 9μ) and the internal intercostal muscles (52μ ± 8μ) (p{\textless}0.01). The diameters of both fiber types were greater in men than in women. There was no significant relationship between measures of pulmonary function or respiratory muscle strength and muscle fiber proportions and diameters. There were significant correlations between the percentage of ideal body weight and type 1 and type 2 fiber diameters. We conclude that sex and nutrition influence respiratory muscle morphometry.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although muscle loss is thought to be a prognostic factor in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), its determinants remain unclear.
AIM: To verify the hypothesis that fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) are associated with the extent of emphysema in COPD patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 112 stable, male current or ex-smokers with or without COPD attending a secondary care specialist COPD clinic were studied. FFM and FM were measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. We also assessed the nutrition status, muscle strength by the handgrip test, exercise tolerance by the 6-minute walking test, airflow limitation and diffusion capacity, the extent of emphysema by high-resolution CT scan, systemic inflammation status using C-reactive protein, and a lipid-related hormone (adiponectin).
RESULTS: The FFM index (FFMI), which was defined as the FFM divided by the square of the body height, was significantly correlated with age, the total number of lymphocytes, handgrip strength, distance on 6-minute walking, airflow limitation, diffusion capacity, extent of emphysema, and C-reactive protein. On multivariate analysis, the FFMI was associated with handgrip strength and inversely correlated with the extent of emphysema. The FM index (FMI) was positively correlated with pack-years, and was inversely correlated with the extent of emphysema and concentrations of adiponectin.
CONCLUSION: The extent of emphysema was correlated with skeletal muscle loss and also the FM.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives
Exacerbations are important outcomes in COPD both from a clinical and an economic perspective. Most studies investigating predictors of exacerbations were performed in COPD patients participating in pharmacological clinical trials who usually have moderate to severe airflow obstruction. This study was aimed to investigate whether predictors of COPD exacerbations depend on the COPD population studied.

Methods
A network of COPD health economic modelers used data from five COPD data sources – two population-based studies (COPDGene® and The Obstructive Lung Disease in Norrbotten), one primary care study (RECODE), and two studies in secondary care (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoint and UPLIFT) – to estimate and validate several prediction models for total and severe exacerbations (= hospitalization). The models differed in terms of predictors (depending on availability) and type of model.

Results
FEV1\% predicted and previous exacerbations were significant predictors of total exacerbations in all five data sources. Disease-specific quality of life and gender were predictors in four out of four and three out of five data sources, respectively. Age was significant only in the two studies including secondary care patients. Other significant predictors of total exacerbations available in one database were: presence of cough and wheeze, pack-years, 6-min walking distance, inhaled corticosteroid use, and oxygen saturation. Predictors of severe exacerbations were in general the same as for total exacerbations, but in addition low body mass index, cardiovascular disease, and emphysema were significant predictors of hospitalization for an exacerbation in secondary care patients.

Conclusions
FEV1\% predicted, previous exacerbations, and disease-specific quality of life were predictors of exacerbations in patients regardless of their COPD severity, while age, low body mass index, cardiovascular disease, and emphysema seem to be predictors in secondary care patients only.},

This study aimed to develop and validate a predictive model to identify patients at risk of developing severe COPD exacerbations using administrative claims data, to facilitate appropriate disease management programs.  Methods: A predictive model was developed using a retrospective cohort of COPD patients aged 55–89 years identified between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2013 using Humana’s claims data. The baseline period was 12 months postdiagnosis, and the prediction period covered months 12–24. Patients with and without severe exacerbations in the prediction period were compared to identify characteristics associated with severe COPD exacerbations. Models were developed using stepwise logistic regression, and a final model was chosen to optimize sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative PV (NPV).  Results: Of 45,722 patients, 5,317 had severe exacerbations in the prediction period. Patients with severe exacerbations had significantly higher comorbidity burden, use of respiratory medications, and tobacco-cessation counseling compared to those without severe exacerbations in the baseline period. The predictive model included 29 variables that were significantly associated with severe exacerbations. The strongest predictors were prior severe exacerbations and higher Deyo–Charlson comorbidity score (OR 1.50 and 1.47, respectively). The best-performing predictive model had an area under the curve of 0.77. A receiver operating characteristic cutoff of 0.4 was chosen to optimize PPV, and the model had sensitivity of 17\%, specificity of 98\%, PPV of 48\%, and NPV of 90\%.  Conclusion: This study found that of every two patients identified by the predictive model to be at risk of severe exacerbation, one patient may have a severe exacerbation. Once at-risk patients are identified, appropriate maintenance medication, implementation of disease-management programs, and education may prevent future exacerbations.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With increasing health care costs that have outpaced those of other industries, payers of health care are moving from a fee-for-service payment model to one in which reimbursement is tied to outcomes. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease where this payment model has been implemented by some payers, and COPD exacerbations are a quality metric that is used. Under an outcomes-based payment model, it is important for health systems to be able to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes so that they can target interventions to improve outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate predictive models that could be used to identify patients at high risk for COPD exacerbations. METHODS: This study was retrospective and observational and included COPD patients treated with a bronchodilator-based combination therapy. We used health insurance claims data to obtain demographics, enrollment information, comorbidities, medication use, and health care resource utilization for each patient over a 6-month baseline period. Exacerbations were examined over a 6-month outcome period and included inpatient (primary discharge diagnosis for COPD), outpatient, and emergency department (outpatient/emergency department visits with a COPD diagnosis plus an acute prescription for an antibiotic or corticosteroid within 5 days) exacerbations. The cohort was split into training (75\%) and validation (25\%) sets. Within the training cohort, stepwise logistic regression models were created to evaluate risk of exacerbations based on factors measured during the baseline period. Models were evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. The base model included all confounding or effect modifier covariates. Several other models were explored using different sets of observations and variables to determine the best predictive model. RESULTS: There were 478,772 patients included in the analytic sample, of which 40.5\% had exacerbations during the outcome period. Patients with exacerbations had slightly more comorbidities, medication use, and health care resource utilization compared with patients without exacerbations. In the base model, sensitivity was 41.6\% and specificity was 85.5\%. Positive and negative predictive values were 66.2\% and 68.2\%, respectively. Other models that were evaluated resulted in similar test characteristics as the base model. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we were not able to predict COPD exacerbations with a high level of accuracy using health insurance claims data from COPD patients treated with bronchodilator-based combination therapy. Future studies should be done to explore predictive models for exacerbations. DISCLOSURES: No outside funding supported this study. Samp is now employed by, and owns stock in, AbbVie.

We analysed data from 3 years follow-up in 178 women and 464 men with COPD, participants in the Euroscop Study who were smokers unexposed to inhaled corticosteroids.
METHODS: Explanatory variables of gender, age, starting age and pack-years smoking, respiratory symptoms, FEV(1)\%FVC and FEV(1)\%IVC (clinically important measures of airway obstruction), body mass index (BMI), and change in smoking were included in multiple linear regression models with baseline and change in post-bronchodilator FEV(1) as dependent variables.
RESULTS: Reduced baseline FEV(1) was associated with respiratory symptoms in men only. Annual decline in FEV(1) was not associated with respiratory symptoms in either men or women, and was 55 ml less in obese men (BMI 30 kg/m(2)) than men having normal BMI, an effect not seen in women. It was 32 ml faster in women with FEV(1)\%FVC{\textless}median than women with less airway obstruction, a larger difference than in men (8 ml per year). It was 17.7 ml/year faster when increasing the daily number of cigarettes by 10 in men only, but not significantly greater than in women.
CONCLUSION: Respiratory symptoms were associated with reduced baseline FEV(1) in men with COPD. In men, obesity was associated with reduced decline and increasing the number of cigarettes smoked with increased decline in lung function. In women more severe airway obstruction was associated with accelerated decline.},

	abstract = {Objectives:
Body composition assessment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is important, as weight loss and muscular wasting are responsible for low exercise capacity in these patients, and low body mass index (BMI) and fat free mass index (FFMI) are important prognostic factors. Our study aims were: (a) to describe body composition in COPD patients referred to a pulmonary rehabilitation center in Bucharest; (b) to examine the relationships between body composition and disease severity (bronchial obstruction, exercise capacity, quality of life); (c) to test if segmental wasting of lower limbs muscle mass (measured by segmental body composition analysis) correlates with decreased exercise capacity.

Material and methods:
We studied 36 consecutive COPD patients referred to our clinic for pulmonary rehabilitation. Patients performed pulmonary function tests, six minutes walking test (6MWT), and health status was evaluated with COPD Assessment Test (CAT). Body composition measurements were performed by direct segmental multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA).

Outcomes:
This study offers the first data on body composition of Romanian COPD patients, The prevalence of nutritional depletion (defined by low BMI and/or low FFMI) among our COPD patients was 22.2\%. Mean FFMI was significantly lower in normal or underweight patients versus overweight or obese patients. Patients with low FFMI had lower exercise capacity at the 6MWT and higher CAT scores than patients with normal FFMI., Depending on the BMI and FFMI values the patients were divided in four categories: normal, semistarvation, sarcopenia and cachexia. The group of patients with sarcopenia (low FFMI and normal BMI) had the lowest mean MIP (Maximal Inspiratory Pressure), the lowest mean 6MWD (six minutes walking distance) and the higher CAT mean scores among all groups. Exercise capacity was significantly lower in muscular depleted patients (with low skeletal muscle mass index - SSMI). MIP correlated significantly with FFMI and SMMI. No correlations were found between parameters of body composition and FEV1 or CAT. Segmental body composition assessment revealed that unbalanced upper/lower skeletal muscle mass is associated with a lower exercise capacity as measured by 6WMT.

Conclusions:
This study offers the first data on body composition of Romanian COPD patients. The prevalence of nutritional depletion is similar to that found in other European studies. No significant correlations were found between FFMI and severity of the disease (bronchial obstruction, distance walked, CAT score). FFMI and SSMI correlated significantly with MIP. Sarcopenic patients had the lowest mean 6MWD, the lowest mean MIP and the highest CAT mean scores. SMMI significantly correlated with 6MWD. Segmental body composition assessment of revealed that "unbalanced" patients had lower results at 6MWT. These results show that body composition evaluation is useful for the assessment of COPD patients referred to pulmonary rehabilitation and should be routinely performed},

	abstract = {Background
No valid tools exist for evaluating the prognosis in the short and medium term after hospital discharge of patients with COPD. Our hypothesis was that a new index based on the CODEX (comorbidity, obstruction, dyspnea, and previous severe exacerbations) index can accurately predict mortality, hospital readmission, and their combination for the period from 3 months to 1 year after discharge in patients hospitalized for COPD.
Methods
A multicenter study of patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbations was used to develop the CODEX index, and a different patient cohort was used for validation. Comorbidity was measured using the age-adjusted Charlson index, whereas dyspnea, obstruction, and severe exacerbations were calculated according to BODEX (BMI, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and previous severe exacerbations) thresholds. Information about mortality and readmissions for COPD or other causes was collected at 3 and 12 months after hospital discharge.
Results
Two sets of 606 and 377 patients were included in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. The CODEX index was associated with mortality at 3 months (P {\textless} .0001; hazard ratio [HR], 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.2-1.8) and 1 year (P {\textless} .0001; HR, 1.3; 95\% CI, 1.2-1.5), hospital readmissions in the same periods, and their combination (all P {\textless} .0001). All CODEX C statistics were superior to those of the BODEX, DOSE (dyspnea, airflow obstruction, smoking status, and exacerbation frequency), and updated ADO (age, dyspnea, and airflow obstruction) indexes.
Conclusions
The CODEX index was a useful predictor of survival and readmission at both 3 months and 1 year after hospital discharge for a COPD exacerbation, with a prognostic capacity superior to other previously published indexes.},

This article provides a systematic review of existing algorithms and the factors associated with their performance in detecting exacerbations and supporting clinical decisions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. An electronic literature search in Medline, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane library was conducted to identify relevant articles published between 2005 and July 2015. A total of 20 studies (16 COPD, 4 asthma) that included research about the use of algorithms in telemonitoring interventions in asthma and COPD were selected. Differences on the applied definition of exacerbation, telemonitoring duration, acquired physiological signals and symptoms, type of technology deployed and algorithms used were found. Predictive models with good clinically reliability have yet to be defined, and are an important goal for the future development of telehealth in chronic respiratory conditions. New predictive models incorporating both symptoms and physiological signals are being tested in telemonitoring interventions with positive outcomes. However, the underpinning algorithms behind these models need be validated in larger samples of patients, for longer periods of time and with wellestablished protocols. In addition, further research is needed to identify novel predictors that enable the early detection of deteriorations, especially in COPD. Only then will telemonitoring achieve the aim of preventing hospital admissions, contributing to the reduction of health resource utilization and improving the quality of life of patients.},

	abstract = {Background Roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, has been approved for the prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. It is unclear which patients will have a favourable benefit–harm balance with roflumilast. Our aim was to quantitatively assess the benefits and harms of roflumilast (500 µg/day) compared with placebo.
Methods We used summary data released by the US Food and Drug Administration to estimate the treatment effects of roflumilast. Data from trials and observational studies were used to estimate the baseline risks for COPD exacerbations and gastrointestinal, neurological and psychiatric harms associated with roflumilast. Using simulation, we calculated the probability that roflumilast provides net benefit. We examined the impacts of different baseline risks for exacerbations and the severity of exacerbations, and varied weights (ie, relative importance) for outcomes and treated death as a competing risk in the analyses.
Results The probability that roflumilast provides net benefit approximates 0\% across different age categories of men and women with varying baseline risks for exacerbations. Using different weights for outcomes did not change the probability that roflumilast provides a net benefit. Only in the sensitivity analysis restricted to the prevention of severe exacerbations was there a probability of {\textgreater}50\% that roflumilast provides a net benefit if the baseline risk of having at least one severe exacerbation per year exceeds 22\%.
Conclusions Our results suggest that roflumilast only provides a net benefit to patients at a high risk of severe exacerbations. Guideline developers should consider different recommendations for patients with COPD at different baseline risks for exacerbations.},

Reliable blood biomarkers are needed to predict prognosis.Objectives: To explore plasma biomarkers associated with an annual change in FEV1 in patients with COPD.Methods: Plasma samples of 261 subjects, all Japanese, with COPD from the 5-year Hokkaido COPD cohort study were analyzed as a hypothesis-generating cohort, and the results were validated using data of 226 subjects with and 268 subjects without airflow limitation, mainly white, from the 4-year COPD Quantification by Computed Tomography, Biomarkers, and Quality of Life (CBQ) study conducted in Denmark. The plasma samples were measured using Human CardiovascularMAP (Myriad RBM, Austin, TX), which could analyze 50 biomarkers potentially linked with inflammatory, metabolic, and tissue remodeling pathways, and single ELISAs were used to confirm the results.Measurements and Main Results: Higher plasma adiponectin levels and a lower leptin/adiponectin ratio at enrollment were significantly associated with an annual decline in FEV1 even after controlling for age, sex, height, and body mass index in the Hokkaido COPD cohort study (P = 0.003, P = 0.004, respectively). A lower plasma leptin/adiponectin ratio was also significantly associated with an annual decline in FEV1 in subjects with airflow limitation in the CBQ study (P = 0.014), the patients of which had largely different clinical characteristics compared with the Hokkaido COPD cohort study. There were no significant associations between lung function decline and adipokine levels in subjects without airflow limitation.Conclusions: A lower leptin/adiponectin ratio was associated with lung function decline in patients with COPD in two independent Japanese and Western cohort studies of populations of different ethnicity. Measure of systemic adipokines may provide utility in predicting patients with COPD at higher risk of lung function decline.},

	abstract = {Background
The impact of airway hyperreactivity (AHR) on respiratory mortality and systemic inflammation among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is largely unknown. We used data from 2 large studies to determine the relationship between AHR and FEV1 decline, respiratory mortality, and systemic inflammation.
Objectives
We sought to determine the relationship of AHR with FEV1 decline, respiratory mortality, and systemic inflammatory burden in patients with COPD in the Lung Health Study (LHS) and the Groningen Leiden Universities Corticosteroids in Obstructive Lung Disease (GLUCOLD) study.
Methods
The LHS enrolled current smokers with mild-to-moderate COPD (n = 5887), and the GLUCOLD study enrolled former and current smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD (n = 51). For the primary analysis, we defined AHR by a methacholine provocation concentration of 4 mg/mL or less, which led to a 20\% reduction in FEV1 (PC20).
Results
The primary outcomes were FEV1 decline, respiratory mortality, and biomarkers of systemic inflammation. Approximately 24\% of LHS participants had AHR. Compared with patients without AHR, patients with AHR had a 2-fold increased risk of respiratory mortality (hazard ratio, 2.38; 95\% CI, 1.38-4.11; P = .002) and experienced an accelerated FEV1 decline by 13.2 mL/y in the LHS (P = .007) and by 12.4 mL/y in the much smaller GLUCOLD study (P = .079). Patients with AHR had generally reduced burden of systemic inflammatory biomarkers than did those without AHR.
Conclusions
AHR is common in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD, affecting 1 in 4 patients and identifies a distinct subset of patients who have increased risk of disease progression and mortality. AHR may represent a spectrum of the asthma-COPD overlap phenotype that urgently requires disease modification.},

COPD patients (n=1,022, mean prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 36\% predicted) initially received formoterol (9 µg b.i.d.) and oral prednisolone (30 mg o.d.) for 2 weeks. After this time, patients were randomised to b.i.d. inhaled budesonide/formoterol 320/9 µg, budesonide 400 µg, formoterol 9 µg or placebo for 12 months.
Postmedication FEV1 improved by 0.21 L and health-related quality of life using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) by 4.5 units after run-in. Fewer patients receiving budesonide/formoterol withdrew from the study than those receiving budesonide, formoterol or placebo. Budesonide/formoterol patients had a prolonged time to first exacerbation (254 versus 96 days) and maintained higher FEV1 (99\% versus 87\% of baseline), both primary variables versus placebo. They had fewer exacerbations (1.38 versus 1.80 exacerbations per patient per year), had higher prebronchodilator peak expiratory flow, and showed clinically relevant improvements in SGRQ versus placebo (−7.5 units). Budesonide/formoterol was more effective than either monocomponent in both primary variables.
Budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler (Symbicort®) maintains the benefit of treatment optimisation, stabilising lung function and delaying exacerbations more effectively than either component drug alone or placebo.},

In a 12-month, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in 812 adults (mean age 64 yrs, mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 36\% predicted normal), patients received two inhalations twice daily of either budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort®) 160/4.5 µg (delivered dose), budesonide 200 µg (metered dose), formoterol 4.5 µg or placebo. Severe exacerbations and FEV1 (primary variables), peak expiratory flow (PEF), COPD symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQL), mild exacerbations, use of reliever β2‐agonist and safety variables were recorded.
Budesonide/formoterol reduced the mean number of severe exacerbations per patient per year by 24\% versus placebo and 23\% versus formoterol. FEV1 increased by 15\% versus placebo and 9\% versus budesonide. Morning PEF improved significantly on day 1 versus placebo and budesonide; after 1 week, morning PEF was improved versus placebo, budesonide and formoterol. Improvements in morning and evening PEF versus comparators were maintained over 12 months. Budesonide/formoterol decreased all symptom scores and use of reliever β2‐agonists significantly versus placebo and budesonide, and improved HRQL versus placebo. All treatments were well tolerated.

Design: Double blind, placebo controlled study.
Setting: Eighteen UK hospitals.
Participants: 751 men and women aged between 40 and 75 years with mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 50\% of predicted normal.
Interventions: Inhaled fluticasone propionate 500 μg twice daily from a metered dose inhaler or identical placebo.
Main outcome measures: Efficacy measures: rate of decline in FEV1 after the bronchodilator and in health status, frequency of exacerbations, respiratory withdrawals. Safety measures: morning serum cortisol concentration, incidence of adverse events.
Results: There was no significant difference in the annual rate of decline in FEV1 (P=0.16). Mean FEV1 after bronchodilator remained significantly higher throughout the study with fluticasone propionate compared with placebo (P{\textless}0.001). Median exacerbation rate was reduced by 25\% from 1.32 a year on placebo to 0.99 a year on with fluticasone propionate (P=0.026). Health status deteriorated by 3.2 units a year on placebo and 2.0 units a year on fluticasone propionate (P=0.0043). Withdrawals because of respiratory disease not related to malignancy were higher in the placebo group (25\% v 19\%, P=0.034).
Conclusions: Fluticasone propionate 500 μg twice daily did not affect the rate of decline in FEV1 but did produce a small increase in FEV1. Patients on fluticasone propionate had fewer exacerbations and a slower decline in health status. These improvements in clinical outcomes support the use of this treatment in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.},

	abstract = {Summary
Background
Little is known about the long-term efficacy inhaled corticosteroids in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We investigated the efficacy of inhaled budesonide on decline in lung function and respiratory symptoms in a 3-year placebo-controlled study of patients with COPD.
Methods
We used a parallel-group, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design in a single-centre study, nested in a continuing epidemiological survey (the Copenhagen City Heart Study). Inclusion criteria were as follows: no asthma; a ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and vital capacity of 0·7 or less; FEV1 which showed no response ({\textless}15\% change) to 1 mg inhaled terbutaline or prednisolone 37·5 mg orally once daily for 10 days. 290 patients were randomly assigned budesonide, 800 μg plus 400 μg daily for 6 months followed by 400 μg twice daily for 30 months, or placebo for 36 months. The mean age of the participants was 59 years and the mean FEV1 2·37 L or 86\% of predicted. The main outcome measure was rate of FEV1 decline. Analyses were by intention to treat.
Findings
The crude rates of FEV1 decline were slightly smaller than expected (placebo group 41·8 mL per year, budesonide group 45·1 mL per year). The estimated rates of decline from the regression model did not differ significantly (49·1 mL vs 46·0 mL per year; difference 3·1 mL per year [95\% CI −12·8 to 19·0]; p=0·7). Before the study, the minimum relevant difference was defined as 20 mL per year; this difference was outside the 95\% CI. No effect of inhaled budesonide was seen on respiratory symptoms. 316 exacerbations occurred during the study period, 155 in the budesonide group and 161 in the placebo group. Treatment was well tolerated.
Interpretation
Inhaled budesonide was of no clinical benefit in COPD patients recruited from the general population by screening. We question the role of long-term inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of mild to moderate COPD.},

In the first 6 months after randomization, ICS use was associated with a significant mean (± SE) relative increase in FEV1of 2.42 ± 0.19\% compared with placebo (p {\textless} 0.01), which is quantifiable in absolute terms as 42 mL in men and 29 mL in women over 6 months. From 6 to 36 months, there was no significant difference between placebo and ICS therapy in terms of FEV1decline (−0.01 ± 0.09\%; p = 0.86). The initial treatment effect was dependent on smoking status and gender. Smokers who continued to smoke had a smaller increase in FEV1during the first 6 months than did ex-smokers. Female ex-smokers had a larger increase in FEV1with ICS therapy than did male ex-smokers. Conclusions:We conclude that in COPD in the first 6 months of treatment, ICS therapy is more effective in ex-smokers than in current smokers with COPD in improving lung function, and women may have a bigger response to ICSs than men. However, it seems that after 6 months, ICS therapy does not modify the decline in FEV1among those who completed these randomized clinical trials.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by an accelerated decline in lung function. No drug has been shown conclusively to reduce this decline.
OBJECTIVES: In a post hoc analysis of the Toward a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) study, we investigated the effects of combined salmeterol 50 microg plus fluticasone propionate 500 microg, either component alone or placebo, on the rate of post-bronchodilator FEV(1) decline in patients with moderate or severe COPD.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted from September 2000 to November 2005 in 42 countries. Of 6,112 patients from the efficacy population, 5,343 were included in this analysis.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Spirometry was measured every 24 weeks for 3 years. There were 26,539 on-treatment observations. The adjusted rate of decline in FEV(1) was 55 ml/year for placebo, 42 ml/year for salmeterol, 42 ml/year for fluticasone propionate, and 39 ml/year for salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate. Salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate reduced the rate of FEV(1) decline by 16 ml/year compared with placebo (95\% confidence interval [CI], 7-25; P {\textless} 0.001). The difference was smaller for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol compared with placebo (13 ml/year; 95\% CI, 5-22; P = 0.003). Rates of decline were similar among the active treatment arms. FEV(1) declined faster in current smokers and patients with a lower body mass index, and varied between world regions. Patients who exacerbated more frequently had a faster FEV(1) decline.
CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacotherapy with salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate, or the components, reduces the rate of decline of FEV(1) in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, thus slowing disease progression.

A prespecified spirometry substudy compared the lung function efficacy between treatment groups.
METHODS: TIOSPIR® was a large-scale, long-term (2.3-year), event-driven, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial of 17,135 patients with COPD. In the spirometry substudy, trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured at baseline and every 24 weeks for the duration of the trial.
RESULTS: The substudy included 1370 patients who received once-daily tiotropium Respimat® 5 μg (n = 461), 2.5 μg (n = 464), or tiotropium HandiHaler® 18 μg (n = 445). Adjusted mean trough FEV1 (average 24-120 weeks) was 1.285, 1.258, and 1.295 L in the Respimat® 5 μg, 2.5 μg, and HandiHaler® 18 μg groups (difference versus HandiHaler® [95 \% CI]: -10 [-38, 18] mL for Respimat® 5 μg and, -37 [-65, -9] mL for Respimat® 2.5 μg); achieving noninferiority to tiotropium HandiHaler® 18 μg for tiotropium Respimat® 5 but not for 2.5 μg (prespecified analysis). Adjusted mean trough FVC was 2.590, 2.544, and 2.593 L in the Respimat® 5 μg, 2.5 μg, and HandiHaler® 18 μg groups. The rates of FEV1 decline over 24 to 120 weeks were similar for the three treatment arms (26, 40, and 34 mL/year for the tiotropium Respimat® 5-μg, 2.5-μg, and HandiHaler® 18-μg groups). The rate of FEV1 decline in GOLD I + II patients was greater than in GOLD III + IV patients (46 vs. 23 mL/year); as well as in current versus ex-smokers, in patients receiving combination therapies at baseline versus not, and in those experiencing an exacerbation during the study versus not.
CONCLUSIONS: The TIOSPIR® spirometry substudy showed that tiotropium Respimat® 5 μg was noninferior to tiotropium HandiHaler® 18 μg for trough FEV1, but Respimat® 2.5 μg was not. Tiotropium Respimat® 5 μg provides similar bronchodilator efficacy to tiotropium HandiHaler® 18 μg with comparable rates of FEV1 decline. The rate of FEV1 decline varied based on disease severity, with a steeper rate of decline observed in patients with moderate airway obstruction.

OBJECTIVES: In a prespecified analysis of the key secondary outcome in SUMMIT (Study to Understand Mortality and Morbidity), we investigated whether the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone furoate (FF; 100 μg), the long-acting β-agonist vilanterol (VI; 25 μg), or their combination (FF/VI) modified the rate of decline in FEV1 compared with placebo. We also investigated how baseline covariates affected this decline.
METHODS: Spirometry was measured every 12 weeks in this event-driven, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 16,485 patients with moderate COPD and heightened cardiovascular risk. An average of seven spirometric assessments per subject among the 15,457 patients with at least one on-treatment measurement were used in the analysis of rate of FEV1 decline. All statistical comparisons are considered nominal.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The adjusted rates of FEV1 decline were -46 ml/yr (-3.0\% of baseline) with placebo, -47 ml/yr (-3.1\%) with VI, -38 ml/yr (-2.5\%) with FF, and -38 ml/yr (-2.3\%) with FF/VI. FF-containing regimens had lower rates of decline than placebo (P {\textless} 0.03), and FF/VI had a lower rate of decline than VI alone (P {\textless} 0.005). The FEV1 decline was faster in current smokers, those with a lower body mass index, males, and patients with established cardiovascular disease.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate COPD and heightened cardiovascular risk, FF alone or in combination with VI appears to reduce the rate of FEV1 decline. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01313676).},

We used data from 2 large studies to determine the relationship between AHR and FEV1 decline, respiratory mortality, and systemic inflammation.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the relationship of AHR with FEV1 decline, respiratory mortality, and systemic inflammatory burden in patients with COPD in the Lung Health Study (LHS) and the Groningen Leiden Universities Corticosteroids in Obstructive Lung Disease (GLUCOLD) study.
METHODS: The LHS enrolled current smokers with mild-to-moderate COPD (n = 5887), and the GLUCOLD study enrolled former and current smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD (n = 51). For the primary analysis, we defined AHR by a methacholine provocation concentration of 4 mg/mL or less, which led to a 20\% reduction in FEV1 (PC20).
RESULTS: The primary outcomes were FEV1 decline, respiratory mortality, and biomarkers of systemic inflammation. Approximately 24\% of LHS participants had AHR. Compared with patients without AHR, patients with AHR had a 2-fold increased risk of respiratory mortality (hazard ratio, 2.38; 95\% CI, 1.38-4.11; P = .002) and experienced an accelerated FEV1 decline by 13.2 mL/y in the LHS (P = .007) and by 12.4 mL/y in the much smaller GLUCOLD study (P = .079). Patients with AHR had generally reduced burden of systemic inflammatory biomarkers than did those without AHR.
CONCLUSIONS: AHR is common in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD, affecting 1 in 4 patients and identifies a distinct subset of patients who have increased risk of disease progression and mortality. AHR may represent a spectrum of the asthma-COPD overlap phenotype that urgently requires disease modification.},

	abstract = {Rationale
Malnutrition in patients with COPD is associated with an impaired pulmonary status, reduced diaphragmatic mass, lower exercise capacity, and higher mortality rate when compared to adequately nourished individuals with COPD. Nutritional support may therefore be a useful part of their comprehensive care.
Purpose
To conduct a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to clarify whether nutritional supplementation (caloric supplementation for at least 2 weeks) improved anthropometric measures, pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, and functional exercise capacity in patients with stable COPD.
Methods
RCTs were identified from several sources, including the Cochrane Airways Group register of RCTs, a hand search of abstracts presented at international meetings, and consultation with experts. Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed quality, and extracted the data. Within each trial and for each outcome, we calculated an effect size. The effect sizes were then pooled by a random-effects model. Homogeneity among the effect sizes was also tested.
Results
From 272 references, nine RCTs were ultimately included. Six articles were considered as high quality. Only two studies were double blinded. For each of the outcomes studied, the effect of nutritional support was small: the 95\% confidence intervals around the pooled effect sizes all included zero. The effect of nutritional support was homogeneous across studies.
Conclusion
Nutritional support had no effect on improving anthropometric measures, lung function, or functional exercise capacity among patients with stable COPD.},

	abstract = {An association between low body mass index (BMI) and poor prognosis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been found in a number of studies. The prevalence and prognostic importance of weight change in unselected subjects with COPD was examined.
Subjects with COPD, defined as forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity {\textless}0.7 in the Copenhagen City Heart Study and who attended two examinations 5 yrs apart, were followed for 14 yrs for COPD-related and all-cause mortality.
The proportion of subjects who lost {\textgreater}1 unit BMI (∼3.8 kg) between the two examinations was significantly associated with level of COPD, reaching ∼30\% in subjects with severe COPD. After adjusting for age, smoking habits, baseline BMI and lung function, weight loss was associated with higher mortality in both persons with and without COPD (rate ratio (RR) for weight loss {\textgreater}3 BMI units 1.71 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.32–2.23) and 1.63 (95\% CI 1.38–1.92), respectively). Weight gain was associated with increased mortality, but not significantly so in subjects with COPD. Risk of COPD-related death increased with weight loss (RR 2.14 (95\% CI 1.18–3.89)), but not with weight gain (RR 0.95 (95\% CI 0.43–2.08)). In subjects without COPD or with mild-to-moderate COPD, the effect of weight change was the same irrespective of initial weight. In subjects with severe COPD, there was a significant risk ratio modification (p=0.045) between effect of baseline BMI and weight change: in the normal-to-underweight (BMI{\textless}25), best survival was seen in those who gained weight, whereas for the overweight and obese (BMI≥25), best survival was seen in stable weight.
A high proportion of subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease experienced a significant weight loss, which was associated with increased mortality. The results support further intervention studies that aim at avoiding weight loss in normal-to-underweight chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Low body mass index (BMI) is a marker of poor prognosis in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In the general population, the harmful effect of low BMI is due to the deleterious effects of a low fat-free mass index (FFMI; fat-free mass/weight(2)).
OBJECTIVES: We explored distribution of low FFMI and its association with prognosis in a population-based cohort of patients with COPD.
METHODS: We used data on 1,898 patients with COPD identified in a population-based epidemiologic study in Copenhagen. FFM was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Patients were followed up for a mean of 7 yr and the association between BMI and FFMI and mortality was examined taking age, sex, smoking, and lung function into account.
MAIN RESULTS: The mean FFMI was 16.0 kg/m(2) for women and 18.7 kg/m(2) for men. Among subjects with normal BMI, 26.1\% had an FFMI lower than the lowest 10th percentile of the general population. BMI and FFMI were significant predictors of mortality, independent of relevant covariates. Being in the lowest 10th percentile of the general population for FFMI was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.5 (95\% confidence interval, 1.2-1.8) for overall mortality and 2.4 (1.4-4.0) for COPD-related mortality. FFMI was also a predictor of overall mortality when analyses were restricted to subjects with normal BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: FFMI provides information in addition to BMI and assessment of FFM should be considered in the routine assessment of COPD.},

Both overweight (body mass index [BMI], 25-29.9 kg/m2) and obese (BMI, {\textgreater} or =30 kg/m2) persons were more likely to have elevated CRP levels than their normal-weight counterparts (BMI, {\textless}25 kg/m2). After adjustment for potential confounders, including smoking and health status, the odds ratio (OR) for elevated CRP was 2.13 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.56-2.91) for obese men and 6.21 (95\% CI, 4.94-7.81) for obese women. In addition, BMI was associated with clinically raised CRP levels in women, with an OR of 4.76 (95\% CI, 3.42-6.61) for obese women. Waist-to-hip ratio was positively associated with both elevated and clinically raised CRP levels, independent of BMI. Restricting the analyses to young adults (aged 17-39 years) and excluding smokers, persons with inflammatory disease, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes mellitus and estrogen users did not change the main findings.
CONCLUSION: Higher BMI is associated with higher CRP concentrations, even among young adults aged 17 to 39 years. These findings suggest a state of low-grade systemic inflammation in overweight and obese persons.},

	abstract = {Following the discovery of TNF-alpha and leptin as secretory products of adipocytes in the early 1990s, subsequent obesity research focused on the new functional role of adipose tissue, as an active endocrine organ. Many more inflammatory peptides have been linked to adiposity, which ultimately characterised obesity as a state of low-grade systemic inflammation, or 'metaflammation' which may link obesity to its co-morbidities. The aim of the present review is to examine the effects of weight loss on inflammation in overweight and obese, but otherwise healthy, populations. Studies were broadly classified into four types (diet, physical activity, diet and physical activity combined, and surgical interventions) and discussed according to the method used to induce weight loss. All studies measured at least one obesity-related inflammatory marker (ORIM). The overall finding from the present review is that weight loss does improve inflammation in terms of both the inflammatory (C-reactive protein, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and leptin) and anti-inflammatory (adiponectin) ORIM. Within this, the greatest improvements in ORIM are observed in studies achieving a weight loss of at least 10 \%. However, a number of methodological issues have been identified as potential limitations within the literature including the sex and age of subjects, sample size, study duration and the assessment of body composition. In conclusion, although a period of weight loss per se is capable of reversing the unfavourable inflammatory profile evident in the obese state, further studies are required to determine the time needed, in which a reduced weight is maintained, in order to benefit from improved inflammatory status long term.},

Blood levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a cytokine causing cachexia in laboratory animals, are elevated in various human diseases associated with weight loss. We therefore prospectively measured TNF-alpha serum levels (immunoradiometric assay) in patients with clinically stable COPD (n = 30; all male; mean age, 65 yr) whose weight was less (Group I; n = 16) or more (Group II; n = 14) than the lower limit of normal taken from Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tables. The patients had no cause known to elevate TNF-alpha serum levels; notably, they were not infected. Group I patients had unintentionally lost weight during the previous year, whereas the weight of Group II patients had not changed during the same period. The two groups had similar chronic airflow obstruction and arterial blood gas impairment; hyperinflation and reduction in diffusing capacity were more pronounced in Group I, but differences were not significant. TNF-alpha serum levels (pg/ml; mean [SD]) were significantly higher in Group I than in Group II (70.2 [100.0] versus 6.7 [6.4]; p {\textless} 0.001). Group II TNF-alpha serum levels did not differ significantly from those of healthy subjects (7.8 [3.9]), whereas those of Group I were significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.001). Because renal function was in the normal range, we conclude that increased TNF-alpha production--and not decreased TNF-alpha clearance--is a likely cause of weight loss in patients with COPD.},

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with chronic inflammation affecting predominantly the lung parenchyma and peripheral airways that results in largely irreversible and progressive airflow limitation. This inflammation is characterized by increased numbers of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, T lymphocytes (predominantly TC1, TH1, and TH17 cells), and innate lymphoid cells recruited from the circulation. These cells and structural cells, including epithelial and endothelial cells and fibroblasts, secrete a variety of proinflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and lipid mediators. Although most patients with COPD have a predominantly neutrophilic inflammation, some have an increase in eosinophil counts, which might be orchestrated by TH2 cells and type 2 innate lymphoid cells though release of IL-33 from epithelial cells. These patients might be more responsive to corticosteroids and bronchodilators. Oxidative stress plays a key role in driving COPD-related inflammation, even in ex-smokers, and might result in activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), impaired antiprotease defenses, DNA damage, cellular senescence, autoantibody generation, and corticosteroid resistance though inactivation of histone deacetylase 2. Systemic inflammation is also found in patients with COPD and can worsen comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Accelerated aging in the lungs of patients with COPD can also generate inflammatory protein release from senescent cells in the lung. In the future, it will be important to recognize phenotypes of patients with optimal responses to more specific therapies, and development of biomarkers that identify the therapeutic phenotypes will be important.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, and muscle wasting. Systemic inflammation may be involved in the pathogenesis of these disorders. A study was undertaken to determine whether systemic inflammation is present in stable COPD.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of studies which reported on the relationship between COPD, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) or forced vital capacity (FVC), and levels of various systemic inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, leucocytes, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukins 6 and 8. Where possible the results were pooled together to produce a summary estimate using a random or fixed effects model.
RESULTS: Fourteen original studies were identified. Overall, the standardised mean difference in the CRP level between COPD and control subjects was 0.53 units (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.72). The standardised mean difference in the fibrinogen level was 0.47 units (95\% CI 0.29 to 0.65). Circulating leucocytes were also higher in COPD than in control subjects (standardised mean difference 0.44 units (95\% CI 0.20 to 0.67)), as were serum TNF-alpha levels (standardised mean difference 0.59 units (95\% CI 0.29 to 0.89)).
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced lung function is associated with increased levels of systemic inflammatory markers which may have important pathophysiological and therapeutic implications for subjects with stable COPD.},

We aim to provide guidance on analysing resource use and costs focusing on randomised trials, although methods often have wider applicability. Twelve broad categories of methods were identified: (I) methods based on the normal distribution, (II) methods following transformation of data, (III) single-distribution generalized linear models (GLMs), (IV) parametric models based on skewed distributions outside the GLM family, (V) models based on mixtures of parametric distributions, (VI) two (or multi)-part and Tobit models, (VII) survival methods, (VIII) non-parametric methods, (IX) methods based on truncation or trimming of data, (X) data components models, (XI) methods based on averaging across models, and (XII) Markov chain methods. Based on this review, our recommendations are that, first, simple methods are preferred in large samples where the near-normality of sample means is assured. Second, in somewhat smaller samples, relatively simple methods, able to deal with one or two of above data characteristics, may be preferable but checking sensitivity to assumptions is necessary. Finally, some more complex methods hold promise, but are relatively untried; their implementation requires substantial expertise and they are not currently recommended for wider applied work.},

	abstract = {Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is prevalent in China. The role of body mass index (BMI) in COPD progression and prognosis is unclear. We analyzed the association between BMI and pulmonary function, inflammation levels and exacerbation in Chinese COPD patients.

Methods
Our retrospective real world research included 744 patients with COPD diagnosed by spirometry and hospitalized from January 1st, 2014 to December 31st, 2016. The indicators were gathered from hospital records database and frequency of exacerbation in the three years were followed up. All 744 patients were divided into four groups by BMI grades. We analyzed the association between BMI and pulmonary function, inflammation levels and exacerbation by Spearman bivariate correlations, Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression.

Results
The singly proportion (median of BMI) of these patients in underweight, normal weight, overweight and obesity was 7.80\% (17.54), 45.97\% (22.12), 27.96\% (27.00) and 18.28\% (31.25) respectively. With increasing of BMI grades, the values of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory flow (FEF25/50/75) and diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) were correspondingly increasing; the percentage of neutrophils and C-reactive protein (CRP) presented significant declining trend while the trend of the percentage of eosinophils was negative; the dose of systemic corticosteroid and length of stay present decreasing tendency; the frequency of exacerbation and hospitalization were decreasing. These were similar results in gender, smoking status COPD subgroups.

Conclusions
In our study, BMI was moderately correlated with pulmonary function positively and exacerbations negatively. To some extent, BMI might be a useful indicator to predict the prognosis of COPD patients and for long-term management.},

However, being overweight or obese has been associated with a better prognosis in subjects suffering from chronic diseases, id est the "obesity paradox". In both community-dwelling and hospitalized patients with COPD, several studies have reported a significant protective effect of obesity on all-cause mortality, indicating that also in obstructive pulmonary diseases, an obesity paradox may be present. Interestingly, the "paradox" is more evident for subjects with severe bronchial obstruction (i.e., a lower FEV1), while in mild-moderate conditions, the weight-related mortality shows a behavior similar to that observed in the general population. Several factors may confound the relation between COPD, obesity and mortality. The lower FEV1 found in obese people may be linked to a restrictive defect rather than to an obstructive one. Due to the modified chest wall mechanical properties-related to increased fat mass-obese COPD patients may present, respect to their lean counterpart, a lower lung hyperinflation which is associated with higher mortality. The traditional classification of COPD attributes to obese "blue bloaters" a low-grade emphysema in opposition to lean "pink puffers"; the fact that emphysema extent is related to mortality may bias the relationship between weight and survival. It is also to underline that the majority of the studies, consider BMI rather than body composition (a better predictor of mortality) when studying the intriguing relation between weight, COPD, and mortality. Reverse bias has also to be taken into account, hypothesizing that an unintentional weight loss may be the deleterious factor related to mortality, rather than considering obesity a protective one. Further prospective studies are needed to shed light on the complexity of this emerging issue.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The "obesity paradox" is defined as an inverse association of good health, survival and obesity. Usually in healthy persons the more obese you are the more metabolic complications you have; however, thin patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have more cardiovascular complications and a higher mortality rate.
OBJECTIVES: To explore whether atherosclerosis and peripheral artery disease (PAD) contribute to the higher morbidity and mortality of patients with COPD.
METHODS: This prospective study included 87 patients with chronic COPD who were treated in the pulmonary outpatient clinic; all signed a consent form before enrollment. We documented their lung function (FEV1\%), body mass index (BMI) and ankle brachial index (ABI). The primary endpoints were to find an association between atherosclerosis and BMI in patients with COPD, and between atherosclerosis and severity of lung disease.
RESULTS: Average ABI was 1.01 +/- 0.20, BMI was 29.33 +/- 7.48 kg/m2, and the abdominal circumference was 107.34 +/- 18.87 cm. A positive correlation was found between BMI and ABI (P=0.001) and between abdominal circumference and ABI (P=0.000). Patients with peripheral artery disease were older (73.6 +/- 11.5 vs. 68.1 +/- 11.6 years old, P= 0.04), were thinner (average BMI 25.5 +/- 6.2 vs. 31.06 +/- 7.3, P= 0.001), and had a lower abdominal circumference (97.7 +/- 18.3 vs. 111.7 +/- 17.5 cm, P=0.001). No such difference was observed for years of smoking. Male PAD patients with COPD had a lower BMI (25.2 +/- 5.6 vs. 29.9 +/- 7.4, P = 0.016), and their abdominal circumference was smaller (96.1 +/- 18.0 vs. 110.2 +/- 16.5 cm, P=0.004). Female PAD patients with COPD had a lower BMI (26.3 +/- 8.2 vs. 33.1 +/- 7.0, P=0.045), but their abdominal circumference was not different from females without PAD (102.0 +/- 19.7 vs. 114.0 +/- 19.4 cm, P=0.162). Patients with PAD had a worse lung disease (FEV1\% 34 +/- 8\% vs. 45 +/- 16\%, P=0.01). During the 1 year of follow-up five patients died: two PAD patients due to acute myocardial infarction and three non-PAD patients died from pulmonary insufficiency (two patients) and pulmonary emboli (one patient).
DISCUSSION: We found that COPD patients with PAD were older and thinner and had a lower abdominal circumference and a more progressive lung disease. Extensive atherosclerosis in patients with COPD may partly explain the "obesity paradox" observed in patients with COPD.},

	abstract = {The early onset of asthma and difficulty of performing spirometry in children {\textless}6 years of age contribute to the lack of standardized terminology to describe the condition in preschool-age children. Presumptive diagnoses in this young age group currently rely on suggestive symptomatology and exclusion of alternative diagnoses. Early diagnosis, however, is vital to avoid treatment delay and to reduce morbidity. Given the the lack of clarity in this area, the aim of the proposed operational criteria and recommendations presented in this position paper is to standardize the diagnosis of asthma in the absence of lung function tests in this particular patient population., Asthma often starts before six years of age. However, there remains uncertainty as to when and how a preschool-age child with symptoms suggestive of asthma can be diagnosed with this condition. This delays treatment and contributes to both short- and long-term morbidity. Members of the Canadian Thoracic Society Asthma Clinical Assembly partnered with the Canadian Paediatric Society to develop a joint working group with the mandate to develop a position paper on the diagnosis and management of asthma in preschoolers., In the absence of lung function tests, the diagnosis of asthma should be considered in children one to five years of age with frequent (≥8 days/month) asthma-like symptoms or recurrent (≥2) exacerbations (episodes with asthma-like signs). The diagnosis requires the objective document of signs or convincing parent-reported symptoms of airflow obstruction (improvement in these signs or symptoms with asthma therapy), and no clinical suspicion of an alternative diagnosis. The characteristic feature of airflow obstruction is wheezing, commonly accompanied by difficulty breathing and cough. Reversibility with asthma medications is defined as direct observation of improvement with short-acting ß2-agonists (SABA) (with or without oral corticosteroids) by a trained health care practitioner during an acute exacerbation (preferred method). However, in children with no wheezing (or other signs of airflow obstruction) on presentation, reversibility may be determined by convincing parental report of a symptomatic response to a three-month therapeutic trial of a medium dose of inhaled corticosteroids with as-needed SABA (alternative method), or as-needed SABA alone (weaker alternative method). The authors provide key messages regarding in whom to consider the diagnosis, terms to be abandoned, when to refer to an asthma specialist and the initial management strategy. Finally, dissemination plans and priority areas for research are identified.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are common diseases with a heterogeneous distribution worldwide. Here, we present methods and disease and risk estimates for COPD and asthma from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) 2015 study. The GBD study provides annual updates on estimates of deaths, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a summary measure of fatal and non-fatal disease outcomes, for over 300 diseases and injuries, for 188 countries from 1990 to the most recent year.
METHODS: We estimated numbers of deaths due to COPD and asthma using the GBD Cause of Death Ensemble modelling (CODEm) tool. First, we analysed data from vital registration and verbal autopsy for the aggregate category of all chronic respiratory diseases. Subsequently, models were run for asthma and COPD relying on covariates to predict rates in countries that have incomplete or no vital registration data. Disease estimates for COPD and asthma were based on systematic reviews of published papers, unpublished reports, surveys, and health service encounter data from the USA. We used the Global Initiative of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease spirometry-based definition as the reference for COPD and a reported diagnosis of asthma with current wheeze as the definition of asthma. We used a Bayesian meta-regression tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, to derive estimates of prevalence and incidence. We estimated population-attributable fractions for risk factors for COPD and asthma from exposure data, relative risks, and a theoretical minimum exposure level. Results were stratified by Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure of income per capita, mean years of education over the age of 15 years, and total fertility rate.
FINDINGS: In 2015, 3·2 million people (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1 million to 3·3 million) died from COPD worldwide, an increase of 11·6\% (95\% UI 5·3 to 19·8) compared with 1990. There was a decrease in age-standardised death rate of 41·9\% (37·7 to 45·1) but this was counteracted by population growth and ageing of the global population. From 1990 to 2015, the prevalence of COPD increased by 44·2\% (41·7 to 46·6), whereas age-standardised prevalence decreased by 14·7\% (13·5 to 15·9). In 2015, 0·40 million people (0·36 million to 0·44 million) died from asthma, a decrease of 26·7\% (-7·2 to 43·7) from 1990, and the age-standardised death rate decreased by 58·8\% (39·0 to 69·0). The prevalence of asthma increased by 12·6\% (9·0 to 16·4), whereas the age-standardised prevalence decreased by 17·7\% (15·1 to 19·9). Age-standardised DALY rates due to COPD increased until the middle range of the SDI before reducing sharply. Age-standardised DALY rates due to asthma in both sexes decreased monotonically with rising SDI. The relation between with SDI and DALY rates due to asthma was attributed to variation in years of life lost (YLLs), whereas DALY rates due to COPD varied similarly for YLLs and years lived with disability across the SDI continuum. Smoking and ambient particulate matter were the main risk factors for COPD followed by household air pollution, occupational particulates, ozone, and secondhand smoke. Together, these risks explained 73·3\% (95\% UI 65·8 to 80·1) of DALYs due to COPD. Smoking and occupational asthmagens were the only risks quantified for asthma in GBD, accounting for 16·5\% (14·6 to 18·7) of DALYs due to asthma.
INTERPRETATION: Asthma was the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease worldwide in 2015, with twice the number of cases of COPD. Deaths from COPD were eight times more common than deaths from asthma. In 2015, COPD caused 2·6\% of global DALYs and asthma 1·1\% of global DALYs. Although there are laudable international collaborative efforts to make surveys of asthma and COPD more comparable, no consensus exists on case definitions and how to measure disease severity for population health measurements like GBD. Comparisons between countries and over time are important, as much of the chronic respiratory burden is either preventable or treatable with affordable interventions.

	abstract = {Background
Treatment of severe asthma may include high dose systemic-steroid therapy which is associated with substantial additional morbidity. This study estimates the additional healthcare costs associated with steroid-induced morbidity by comparing three patients groups: those with severe asthma, moderate asthma and no asthma.

Methods
Patients with severe asthma (n = 808, GINA step 5 treatment) were matched by age and gender with patients with mild/moderate asthma (n = 3,975, GINA step 2 and 3 treatment) and a non-asthma control cohort (with a diagnosis of rhinitis; n = 2,412) from the Optimum Patient Care Research Database (OPCRD), a nationally representative primary care database. Prescribed drugs and publicly funded healthcare activity were monetised and annual costs per patient estimated. Regression analyses were used to estimate the additional healthcare cost associated with steroid-induced morbidity.

Results
Average healthcare costs per person per year range from £2603 - £4533 for the severe asthma cohort, to £978 - £2072 for the mild/moderate asthma cohort, to £560 - £1324 for the non-asthma control cohort, depending on the costing scenario. Differences in induced morbidity costs were evident between patients with asthma differentiated by steroid exposure. In relation to prescription drugs used to treat steroid-induced co-morbidities, females with severe asthma and high steroid exposure cost approximately £789 more per year than a corresponding female with no asthma, while males cost approximately £744 more than their counterparts with no asthma. Estimates were extrapolated to all healthcare costs.

Conclusions
This study provides the first robust estimates of the additional cost of healthcare related to steroid-induced morbidity relative to patients with no steroid exposure. The study will help inform use of steroid-sparing strategies in this patient group.

	abstract = {Background Little is known about the prevalence of severe, uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma (SUEA) and associated costs.
Aims We sought to determine the prevalence of SUEA and compare asthma-related healthcare resource use (HCRU) and associated costs with overall means for a general asthma population.
Methods This cohort study evaluated anonymised medical record data (December 1989 through June 2015) from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and the Optimum Patient Care Research Database to study UK patients with active asthma (diagnostic code and one or more drug prescriptions in the baseline year), aged 5 years and older, without concomitant COPD, and with recorded eosinophil count. SUEA was defined as two or more asthma attacks during 1 baseline year preceding a high blood eosinophil count (≥0.3×109/L) for patients prescribed long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) and high-dosage inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) during baseline plus 1 follow-up year. We compared asthma-related HCRU and associated direct costs (2015 pounds sterling, £) during the follow-up year for SUEA versus the general asthma population.
Results Of 363 558 patients with active asthma and recorded eosinophil count, 64\% were women, mean (SD) age was 49 (21) years; 43\% had high eosinophil counts, 7\% had two or more attacks in the baseline year and 10\% were prescribed high-dosage ICS/LABA for 2 study years. Overall, 2940 (0.81\%; 95\% CI 0.78\% to 0.84\%) patients had SUEA. Total mean per-patient HCRU and associated costs were four times greater for SUEA versus all patients (HCRU and cost ratios 3.9; 95\% CI 3.7 to 4.1).
Conclusions Less than 1\% of patients in a general asthma population had SUEA. These patients accounted for substantially greater asthma-related HCRU and costs than average patients with asthma.},

Patients were matched on demographic characteristics and asthma severity during 1 baseline year, and asthma control and asthma-related costs were compared during 1 outcome year.Results:In both the UK and US, adjusted odds of risk-domain asthma control were similar, whereas the odds of overall control (no hospitalisation or oral steroids for asthma, no antibiotics for lower respiratory infection, limited reliever use) were greater for extrafine ICS in both countries (UK odds ratio, 1.23; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.01–1.50). Asthma-related annual costs, adjusted for baseline, were significantly lower for extrafine-particle ICS cohorts in both countries (UK difference, −£66 (95\% CI,−93 to −37)). Cost-effectiveness analyses using the two measures of asthma control found 92 and 98\% probabilities of extrafine-particle ICS being the preferred treatment strategy (less costly and more effective than standard size-particle ICS) in the UK, and 84 and 100\% probabilities in the US.Conclusions:Initiating ICS therapy for asthma as extrafine-particle ICS seems the dominant treatment option (less costly and more effective) compared with standard size-particle ICS in both the UK and the US.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives
Exacerbations are important outcomes in COPD both from a clinical and an economic perspective. Most studies investigating predictors of exacerbations were performed in COPD patients participating in pharmacological clinical trials who usually have moderate to severe airflow obstruction. This study was aimed to investigate whether predictors of COPD exacerbations depend on the COPD population studied.

Methods
A network of COPD health economic modelers used data from five COPD data sources – two population-based studies (COPDGene® and The Obstructive Lung Disease in Norrbotten), one primary care study (RECODE), and two studies in secondary care (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoint and UPLIFT) – to estimate and validate several prediction models for total and severe exacerbations (= hospitalization). The models differed in terms of predictors (depending on availability) and type of model.

Results
FEV1\% predicted and previous exacerbations were significant predictors of total exacerbations in all five data sources. Disease-specific quality of life and gender were predictors in four out of four and three out of five data sources, respectively. Age was significant only in the two studies including secondary care patients. Other significant predictors of total exacerbations available in one database were: presence of cough and wheeze, pack-years, 6-min walking distance, inhaled corticosteroid use, and oxygen saturation. Predictors of severe exacerbations were in general the same as for total exacerbations, but in addition low body mass index, cardiovascular disease, and emphysema were significant predictors of hospitalization for an exacerbation in secondary care patients.

Conclusions
FEV1\% predicted, previous exacerbations, and disease-specific quality of life were predictors of exacerbations in patients regardless of their COPD severity, while age, low body mass index, cardiovascular disease, and emphysema seem to be predictors in secondary care patients only.},

The concept of early COPD is not new, but it has recently regained interest, given new population data, recent cellular and molecular advances and insights from clinical trials. To date, many knowledge gaps in the nature of early COPD still exist, mainly because COPD has always been considered a disease of the elderly, and little attention has been paid to the pathological changes occurring in the lungs of individuals at risk before they develop clinically evident COPD. Future studies should focus on identifying early pathological manifestations of COPD in order to prevent its progression in susceptible individuals. In this review, we aim to summarise what is known on early COPD, from the epidemiological, cellular and clinical perspectives.

	abstract = {Statistical modeling is a powerful tool for developing and testing theories by way of causal explanation, prediction, and description. In many disciplines there is near-exclusive use of statistical modeling for causal explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power are inherently of high predictive power. Conflation between explanation and prediction is common, yet the distinction must be understood for progressing scientific knowledge. While this distinction has been recognized in the philosophy of science, the statistical literature lacks a thorough discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for an explanatory versus a predictive goal. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the distinction between explanatory and predictive modeling, to discuss its sources, and to reveal the practical implications of the distinction to each step in the modeling process.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous research has shown that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) tend to have a higher risk for cognitive impairment and dementia, a neurodegenerative disorder. The goal of this study was to examine what relationship, if any, exists between COPD and Parkinson's disease (PD), which is also a neurodegenerative disorder.
METHOD: Our study analyzed medical data from the population of Taiwan from 1998 to 2008, with a follow-up period extending to the end of 2010. We identified patients with COPD by the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). We selected a comparison cohort from the general population that was random frequency-matched by age (in 5-year increments), sex and index year, and further analyzed the risk of PD using Cox's regression model, including sex, age and comorbidities.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 20 728 COPD patients (71.1\% male, mean age = 68.2 years) and 41 147 controls. The risk of developing PD was 1.37 times greater in patients with COPD compared with patients without COPD after adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities. A significantly increased risk of PD was also found in patients with COPD who had any comorbidity other than diabetes.
CONCLUSION: This nationwide retrospective cohort study demonstrates that PD risk is significantly increased in patients with COPD compared with those of the general population.},

Over 160,000 data points from 72 centres in 33 countries were shared with the European Respiratory Society Global Lung Function Initiative. Eliminating data that could not be used (mostly missing ethnic group, some outliers) left 97,759 records of healthy nonsmokers (55.3\% females) aged 2.5-95 yrs. Lung function data were collated and prediction equations derived using the LMS method, which allows simultaneous modelling of the mean (mu), the coefficient of variation (sigma) and skewness (lambda) of a distribution family. After discarding 23,572 records, mostly because they could not be combined with other ethnic or geographic groups, reference equations were derived for healthy individuals aged 3-95 yrs for Caucasians (n=57,395), African-Americans (n=3,545), and North (n=4,992) and South East Asians (n=8,255). Forced expiratory value in 1 s (FEV(1)) and forced vital capacity (FVC) between ethnic groups differed proportionally from that in Caucasians, such that FEV(1)/FVC remained virtually independent of ethnic group. For individuals not represented by these four groups, or of mixed ethnic origins, a composite equation taken as the average of the above equations is provided to facilitate interpretation until a more appropriate solution is developed. Spirometric prediction equations for the 3-95-age range are now available that include appropriate age-dependent lower limits of normal. They can be applied globally to different ethnic groups. Additional data from the Indian subcontinent and Arabic, Polynesian and Latin American countries, as well as Africa will further improve these equations in the future.},

Caucasian subjects had higher mean FVC and FEV1 values than did Mexican-American and African-American subjects across the entire age range. However, Caucasian and Mexican-American subjects had similar FVC and FEV1 values with respect to height, and African-American subjects had lower values. These differences may be partially due to differences in body build: observed Mexican-Americans were shorter than Caucasian subjects of the same age, and African-Americans on average have a smaller trunk:leg ratio than do Caucasians. Reference values and lower limits of normal were derived using a piecewise polynomial model with age and height as predictors.

Asthma groups sharing similar medication profiles were identified by a clustering method relying on all medications and were studied in association with adverse asthma events (uncontrolled asthma, attacks/exacerbations and poor asthma-related quality of life).The network-based analysis showed more multimedication in women with asthma than in those without asthma. The clustering method identified three multimedication profiles in asthma: "Few multimorbidity-related medications" (43.5\%), "Predominantly allergic multimorbidity-related medications" (32.8\%) and "Predominantly metabolic multimorbidity-related medications" (23.7\%). Compared with women belonging to the "Few multimorbidity-related medications" profile, women belonging to the two other profiles had an increased risk of uncontrolled asthma and asthma attacks/exacerbations, and had lower asthma-related quality of life.The integrative data-driven approach on drug administrative databases identified specific multimorbidity-related medication profiles that were associated with poor asthma prognosis.

What if the origins of COPD occurred much earlier? If this were true, it would have major implications for detection (screening) and prevention of COPD. Convincing evidence is hard to obtain, because it requires exceptionally long follow-up, such as half a life span, a period that is often longer than the average career of a researcher! Williams and McNichol established such a longitudinal asthma study from a 1957 birth cohort, and now Tai et al 1 evaluate for an association between childhood asthma and adult COPD. They followed-up a cohort of 6–7-year-old children over more than four decades, of whom 197 survivors completed lung function testing and questionnaires at age 50 years. The most important result reported by the authors was that children with more severe asthma were at increased risk (OR 32; 95\% CI, 3 to 269) of developing adult COPD. Specifically, of those who had more severe asthma in childhood, 44\% (15/34) were diagnosed with adult COPD and 41\% (14/34) with adult asthma, while 15\% (5/34) showed asthma remission at age 50 years. By contrast, adult COPD affected only 8\% (13/163) of those who had intermittent or no childhood asthma. Thus, adults who suffered from more severe asthma in childhood have more commonly COPD.

Physical inactivity and metabolic syndrome are relevant conditions leading to systemic inflammation in the general population. Recent data indicate that physical inactivity and coexisting metabolic syndrome are also independently related to systemic inflammation in patients with COPD. Concerning asthma, only limited data about systemic inflammatory markers exist. Some studies found systemic inflammatory markers to be elevated in patients with nonallergic asthma and obese patients with asthma. Further research should elucidate the complex relationship between obstructive lung disease, coexisting conditions, systemic inflammation accompanying these different conditions, and the causative role of systemic inflammation for comorbidities in COPD and asthma.},

Systemic inflammation is suggested to play an important role in a group of asthma patients. We hypothesized that there is a subgroup of patients with asthma characterized by systemic inflammation. In this study, we aimed to discriminate asthma subtypes based on circulating biomarkers and to determine whether a systemic inflammatory endotype of asthma could be identified. In the present cross-sectional study, 50 patients with untreated asthma were prospectively recruited from a single academic outpatient clinic, and characterized with respect to clinical, functional, and inflammatory parameters. The expression profiles of 20 serum cytokines were assessed by anti-human cytokine antibody array. Then, hierarchical clustering analysis was performed based on principal component analysis (PCA)-transformed data to classify the clinical groups. PCA showed that 6 independent components accounted for 80.113\% of the variance, and PCA-based hierarchical clustering identified 3 endotypes. One of the endotypes was evidenced by elevated systemic inflammation markers such as leptin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and reduced levels of soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), an anti-inflammatory molecule. More female patients were included, with higher circulating neutrophil counts and more severe symptoms. In conclusion, we identified an endotype of asthma characterized by systemic inflammation and severe symptoms. Increased levels of VEGF, leptin and decreased level of sRAGE may contribute to the systemic inflammation of this asthma endotype.},

Acute exacerbations of asthma substantially contribute to disease morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs, and are not restricted to patients who are not compliant with their treatment regimens. Given that respiratory viral infections are the principal cause of asthma exacerbations, this review article will explore the relationship between viral infections and asthma, and will put forward hypotheses as to why virus-induced exacerbations occur. Potential mechanisms that may explain why current therapeutics do not fully inhibit virus-induced exacerbations, for example, β2-adrenergic desensitisation and corticosteroid insensitivity, are explored, as well as which aspects of virus-induced inflammation are likely to be attenuated by current therapy.

	abstract = {Asthma is an increasingly common disorder, affecting 5–10\% of the population. It involves a dysregulated immune function, which may predispose to subsequent cancer. We examined cancer risk among Swedish subjects who had hospital admission once or multiple times for asthma. An asthma research database was created by identifying asthma patients from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and by linking them with the Cancer Registry. A total of 140 425 patients were hospitalised for asthma during 1965–2004, of whom 7421 patients developed cancer, giving an overall standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.36. A significant increase was noted for most sites, with the exception of breast and ovarian cancers and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and myeloma. Patients with multiple hospital admissions showed a high risk, particularly for stomach (SIR 1.70) and colon (SIR 1.99) cancers. A significant decrease was noted for endometrial cancer and skin melanoma. Oesophageal and lung cancers showed high risks throughout the study period, whereas stomach cancer increased towards the end of the period. The relatively stable temporal trends suggest that the asthmatic condition rather than its medication is responsible for the observed associations.},

METHODS: We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CDSR, OHE-HEED, and Web of Science Databases between 1966 and 2008.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Hospitalization and medications were found to be the most important cost driver of direct costs. Work and school loss accounted for the greatest percentage of indirect costs. The cost of asthma was correlated with comorbidities, age, and disease severity.
CONCLUSION: Despite the availability of effective preventive therapy, costs associated with asthma are increasing. Strategies including education of patients and physicians, and regular follow-up are required to reduce the economic burden of asthma.},

The aim of this study was to estimate the direct and indirect cost of asthma among adult patients in Italy, and to assess the relationship between healthcare resource use and asthma severity according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) classification system. A multicentre cross-sectional study was conducted in 16 Italian hospital-based specialised asthma clinics. Data collection was based on self-administered questionnaires and took place during the period May 1-November 30, 1999, and 500 consecutive patients with asthma, aged 18-55 yrs, were enrolled during regularly scheduled visits. Direct costs (drugs, physician visits, emergency service use and hospitalisation), indirect costs (loss of paid workdays) and total costs were determined in euros (Euros) for 1999. Patients with more severe disease, as classified by the GINA guideline, exhibited more night-time and daytime symptoms and were more limited in performing normal daily activities. The mean total cost of asthma per patient per year was estimated to be Euros 1,260; drug costs accounted for 16\%, physician costs 12\%, emergency service and hospitalisation costs 20\% and indirect costs 52\% of the mean cost. Stratified by severity, the total annual cost per patient amounted to Euros 720, Euros 1,046, Euros 1,535 and Euros 3,328 for patients with intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent and severe persistent asthma, respectively. Asthma severity, as determined by the Global Initiative for Asthma classification, is significantly associated with symptoms, limitations in normal daily activities, asthma-related medical resource utilisation and both direct and indirect costs.

	abstract = {Objective
To develop a parsimonious model of the respiratory patient population in British Columbia (BC), Canada through latent class modelling (LCM), using administrative data records and to assess conventional case definitions for asthma in relation to model-based case selection.

Data Sources
1996–2001 data from linked provincial databases containing fee-for-service physician billing records, hospital inpatient separation abstracts, and prescription drug purchase records for 1.9 million BC respiratory patients.

Study Design
This is a retrospective methodological/descriptive study that assesses case definitions for asthma in terms of sensitivity and specificity using a model fitted to seven physician, hospital and medication utilization markers in place of a conventional gold standard.

Data Collection
We computed values of the treatment markers for each of the 5 years for each patient aged 5–55 years who had had at least one occurrence of a respiratory diagnosis code.

Principal Findings
The marker for prescription of short-acting β agonists (SABAs) consistently had the highest sensitivity. Markers' specificities ranged from 0.97 to 1.0. The conventional case definitions' sensitivities were 0.41–0.87; specificities ranged from 0.98 to 0.997. Model-based estimates of asthma prevalence increased from 827/10,000 in 1996 to 992/10,000 in 2001. Conventional case definitions' estimates were consistently lower.

Conclusions
The linkage between utilization and case status is more complex than conventional case definitions allow for. LCM-based case classification was consistent over time and tends to lead to larger prevalence estimates than conventional definitions. The estimated increases in asthma prevalence are reliable. LCM provides health services planners with a useful probability-based approach for developing and assessing case definitions and estimating case prevalence.},

Nevertheless, few epidemiological studies have focussed on severe asthma. The aim of this state of the art review is to describe the criteria used to estimate asthma severity and to assess the prevalence of severe asthma from population-based epidemiological studies.
OBSERVATIONS: Asthma severity has been defined in various ways in epidemiology, with criteria based on symptoms, hospitalisation, ventilatory function, discomfort caused by asthma attacks, and treatment. A high variability in the prevalence of severe asthma is observed, resulting mostly from the lack of standardisation in the phenotypes used, but also from a real geographical heterogeneity. Nevertheless, the prevalence of severe asthma may be reasonably estimated between 1 and 3\% of the general population, both in children and adults.
CONCLUSION: Data from the literature show a lack of standardisation of the severe asthma phenotype. Further epidemiological studies are needed to understand the geographical variability in severe asthma prevalence.},

	abstract = {An important question in the evaluation of an additional risk prediction
marker is how to interpret a small increase in the area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC). Many researchers believe that a change in
AUC is a poor metric because it increases only slightly with the addition of a
marker with a large odds ratio. Because it is not possible on purely statistical
grounds to choose between the odds ratio and AUC, we invoke decision analysis,
which incorporates costs and benefits. For example a timely estimate of the risk
of later non-elective operative delivery can help a woman in labor decide if she
wants an early elective cesarean section to avoid greater complications from
possible later non-elective operative delivery. A basic risk prediction model
for later non-elective operative delivery involves only antepartum markers.
Because adding intrapartum markers to this risk prediction model increases AUC
by 0.02, we questioned whether this small improvement is worthwhile. A key
decision-analytic quantity is the risk threshold, here the risk of later
non-elective operative delivery at which a patient would be indifferent between
an early elective cesarean section and usual care. For a range of risk
thresholds, we found that an increase in the net benefit of risk prediction
requires collecting intrapartum marker data on 68 to 124 women for every correct
prediction of later non-elective operative delivery. Because data collection is
non-invasive, this test tradeoff of 68 to 124 is clinically acceptable,
indicating the value of adding intrapartum markers to the risk prediction
model.},

Much of the decline is due to reductions in risk factors which the Framingham Heart Study helped to identify. The Framingham Heart Study also helped to classify those at highest risk by creating multivariate risk scores. As a result other investigators have created various risk prediction scores for their countries. These scores have been the foundation for guidelines and prevention strategies in developed countries. However, most scores requiring blood tests may be difficult to implement in developing countries where limited resources for screening exist. New studies and risk scores inspired by the Framingham Heart Study need to simplify risk scoring in developing countries so affordable prevention strategies can be implemented.},

The patients were 2489 men and 2856 women 30 to 74 years old at baseline with 12 years of follow-up. During the 12 years of follow-up, a total of 383 men and 227 women developed CHD, which was significantly associated with categories of blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol (all P{\textless}.001). Sex-specific prediction equations were formulated to predict CHD risk according to age, diabetes, smoking, JNC-V blood pressure categories, and NCEP total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol categories. The accuracy of this categorical approach was found to be comparable to CHD prediction when the continuous variables themselves were used. After adjustment for other factors, ≈28\% of CHD events in men and 29\% in women were attributable to blood pressure levels that exceeded high normal (≥130/85). The corresponding multivariable-adjusted attributable risk percent associated with elevated total cholesterol (≥200 mg/dL) was 27\% in men and 34\% in women.Conclusions—Recommended guidelines of blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol effectively predict CHD risk in a middle-aged white population sample. A simple coronary disease prediction algorithm was developed using categorical variables, which allows physicians to predict multivariate CHD risk in patients without overt CHD.},

	abstract = {Objective This study aims to examine the validity of the Framingham general cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk chart in a primary care setting.
Design This is a 10-year retrospective cohort study.
Setting A primary care clinic in a teaching hospital in Malaysia.
Participants 967 patients’ records were randomly selected from patients who were attending follow-up in the clinic.
Main outcome measures Baseline demographic data, history of diabetes and smoking, blood pressure (BP), and serum lipids were captured from patient records in 1998. Each patient's Framingham CVD score was computed from these parameters. All atherosclerotic CVD events occurring between 1998 and 2007 were counted.
Results In 1998, mean age was 57 years with 33.8\% men, 6.1\% smokers, 43.3\% diabetics and 59.7\% hypertensive. Median BP was 140/80 mm Hg and total cholesterol 6.0 mmol/L (1.3). The predicted median Framingham general CVD risk score for the study population was 21.5\% (IQR 1.2–30.0) while the actual CVD events that occurred in the 10 years was 13.1\% (127/967). The median CVD points for men was 30.0, giving them a CVD risk of more than 30\%; for women it is 18.5, a CVD risk of 21.5\%. Our study found that the Framingham general CVD risk score to have moderate discrimination with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.63. It also discriminates well for Malay (AUC 0.65, p=0.01), Chinese (AUC 0.60, p=0.03), and Indians (AUC 0.65, p=0.001). There was good calibration with Hosmer-Lemeshow test χ2=3.25, p=0.78.
Conclusions Taking into account that this cohort of patients were already on treatment, the Framingham General CVD Risk Prediction Score predicts fairly accurately for men and overestimates somewhat for women. In the absence of local risk prediction charts, the Framingham general CVD risk prediction chart is a reasonable alternative for use in a multiethnic group in a primary care setting.},

	abstract = {An important question in the evaluation of an additional risk prediction marker is how to interpret a small increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Many researchers believe that a change in AUC is a poor metric because it increases only slightly with the addition of a marker with a large odds ratio. Because it is not possible on purely statistical grounds to choose between the odds ratio and AUC, we invoke decision analysis, which incorporates costs and benefits. For example, a timely estimate of the risk of later non-elective operative delivery can help a woman in labor decide if she wants an early elective cesarean section to avoid greater complications from possible later non-elective operative delivery. A basic risk prediction model for later non-elective operative delivery involves only antepartum markers. Because adding intrapartum markers to this risk prediction model increases AUC by 0.02, we questioned whether this small improvement is worthwhile. A key decision-analytic quantity is the risk threshold, here the risk of later non-elective operative delivery at which a patient would be indifferent between an early elective cesarean section and usual care. For a range of risk thresholds, we found that an increase in the net benefit of risk prediction requires collecting intrapartum marker data on 68 to 124 women for every correct prediction of later non-elective operative delivery. Because data collection is non-invasive, this test tradeoff of 68 to 124 is clinically acceptable, indicating the value of adding intrapartum markers to the risk prediction model.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The global prevalence of childhood asthma is increasing. The condition impacts physical and psychosocial morbidity; therefore wide-ranging effects on health and education outcomes are plausible.
METHODS: Linkage of eight Scotland-wide databases, covering dispensed prescriptions, hospital admissions, maternity records, death certificates, annual pupil census, examinations, school absences/exclusions and unemployment, provided data on 683 716 children attending Scottish schools between 2009 and 2013. We compared schoolchildren on medication for asthma with peers, adjusting for sociodemographic, maternity and comorbidity confounders, and explored effect modifiers and mediators.
RESULTS: The 45 900 (6.0\%) children treated for asthma had an increased risk of hospitalisation, particularly within the first year of treatment (IRR 1.98, 95\% CI 1.93-2.04), and increased mortality (HR 1.77, 95\% CI 1.30-2.40). They were more likely to have special educational need for mental (OR 1.76, 95\% CI 1.49-2.08) and physical (OR 2.76, 95\% CI 2.57-2.95) health reasons, and performed worse in school exams (OR 1.11, 95\% CI 1.06-1.16). Higher absenteeism (IRR 1.25, 95\% CI 1.24-1.26) partially explained their poorer attainment.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with treated asthma have poorer education and health outcomes than their peers. Educational interventions that mitigate the adverse effects of absenteeism should be considered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite Canada's provision of universal health coverage, socioeconomic barriers to good-quality health care remain. Asthma provides an appropriate case study given its high prevalence, availability of effective controller therapies, and known variations in care.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to examine the extent of differences in the economic burden of asthma and indicators of guideline-based care across socioeconomic status (SES) gradients.
RESEARCH DESIGN: A total of 29,283 adults with moderate to severe asthma were identified from British Columbia's administrative health data for the year 1997-2013 and were matched to adults without asthma on the basis of sex and age. Direct medical costs (in 2013 Canadian dollars, \$) included all-cause inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy costs. SES was measured at individual (receiving social assistance) and aggregate (median neighborhood household income) levels. We assessed the impact of SES on excess direct costs of asthma (the difference in all-cause direct medical costs between an asthma patient and the matched individual), and on use of asthma controller versus reliever medications. Associations were evaluated using generalized linear models.
RESULTS: Asthmatics receiving social assistance incurred \$706 (95\% confidence interval, \$302-\$1014) higher annual excess costs than the rest of the sample. Annual excess costs were \$120 (\$18-\$168) higher in low-SES versus high-SES neighborhoods. Low SES, at both individual and aggregate levels, was consistently associated with lower expenses on controller medications and higher expenses on reliever medications, indicators of suboptimal asthma care and control.
CONCLUSION: Even under universal health care, individuals in lower SES groups did not receive guideline-based asthma care, potentially explaining their higher costs.},

In this commentary, we describe a methodological framework that supports the simultaneous examination of a "matrix" of treatments and outcomes in non-randomized data.
METHODS: We outline the methodological challenges to a matrix-type study (matrix design). We consider propensity score matching with multiple treatment groups, statistical analysis, and choice of association measure when evaluating multiple outcomes. We also discuss multiple testing, use of high-dimensional propensity scores for covariate balancing in light of multiple outcomes, and suitability of available software.
CONCLUSION: The matrix design study methods facilitate examination of the comparative benefits and harms of competing treatment choices, and also provides the input required for calculating the numbers needed to treat and for a broader benefit/harm assessment that weighs endpoints of varying severity.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Despite effective treatments, a large proportion of asthma patients do not achieve sustained asthma control. The ‘preventable’ burden associated with lack of proper control is likely taking a high toll at the personal and population level.  Objective: We predicted the future excess health and economic burden associated with uncontrolled asthma among American adolescents and adults for the next 20 years.  Methods: We built a probabilistic model that linked state-specific estimates of population growth and aging, asthma prevalence, and asthma control levels. We conducted several meta-analyses to estimate the adjusted differences in healthcare resource use, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and productivity loss across control levels. We projected, nationally and at the state-level, total direct and indirect (due to productivity loss) costs (in 2018 dollars) and QALYs lost due to uncontrolled asthma from 2019 to 2038. Measurements and Main Results: Total 20-year direct costs associated with uncontrolled asthma are estimated to be \$300.6 billion (95\% confidence interval [CI] \$190.1–\$411.1). When indirect costs are added, total economic burden will be \$963.5 billion (95\%CI \$664.1B–\$1,262.9B). American adolescents and adults will lose an estimated 15.46 million (95\%CI 12.77M–18.14M) QALYs over this period due to uncontrolled asthma. Conclusion: The burden of uncontrolled asthma is substantial and will continue to grow. Given that a substantial fraction of this burden is preventable, better adherence to evidence-informed asthma management strategies by care providers and patients has the potential to substantially reduce costs and improve quality of life.

Sleep disruption and exercised induced airflow limitation have a negative impact on participation in sports and social activities, and may influence family life. The goal of asthma therapy is to achieve asthma control, but only a limited number of patients are able to reach total control. This may be due to an incorrect diagnosis, co-morbidities or poor inhalation technique, but in the majority of cases non-adherence is the main reason for therapy failures. However, partnership with the parents and the child is important in order to set individually chosen goals of therapy and may be of help to improve control. Non-pharmacological measures aim at avoiding tobacco smoke, and when a child is sensitised, to avoid allergens.

	abstract = {Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are prone to acute respiratory exacerbations, which can develop suddenly or subacutely over the course of several days. Exacerbations have a detrimental effect on patients' health status and increase the burden on the healthcare system. Initial treatment is unsuccessful in 24-27\% of patients, who have a relapse or a second exacerbation within 30 days of the initial event. No obvious benefit has been seen in recent clinical trials of anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy, anti-leukotriene therapy, intensive chest physiotherapy, or early inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation for treatment of exacerbations. By contrast, clinical trials of prevention rather than acute treatment have shown promising results. Long acting β agonist (LABA) or long acting anti-muscarinic (LAMA) bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid-LABA combinations prevent exacerbations in patients at risk, with relative risk reductions averaging 14-27\% for each of these drugs relative to placebo. Triple therapy with inhaled corticosteroid-LABA plus LAMA may provide additional benefit, although study results to date are heterogeneous and more studies are needed. Pneumonia is an important complication of treatment with inhaled corticosteroid-LABA products, and the risk of pneumonia seems to be doubled in patients with COPD who use fluticasone. The addition of azithromycin to usual COPD therapy prevents exacerbations, although it may prolong the Q-T interval and increase the risk of death from cardiovascular disease in patients prone to arrhythmia. New potential drugs--including mitogen activated protein kinase inhibitors, phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies to the interleukin 1 receptor--offer additional hope for treatments that may prevent exacerbations in the future.},

Control (non-SCS) patients were matched by sex and index date with those initiating SCS. Minimum baseline period was 1 year prior to index date; minimum follow-up duration was 2 years post–index date. Cumulative incidence of SCS-associated adverse outcomes and associated HCRU and costs were compared between SCS and non-SCS patient groups and among average SCS daily exposure categories. Associations between exposure and annualized HCRU and costs were assessed, adjusted for confounders. Results Analyses included 9413 matched pairs. Median (interquartile range) follow up was as follows: SCS group: 7.1 (4.1-11.8) years; control group: 6.4 (3.8-10.0) years. Greater SCS dosages were correlated with greater cumulative incidence. For example, patients with type 2 diabetes receiving an average daily dosage of ≥7.5 mg had a 15-year cumulative incidence (37.5\%) that was 1.5-5 times greater than those receiving lower dosages. HCRU and costs increased annually for SCS patients but not for non-SCS patients. Increases in all-cause adverse outcome (excluding asthma)–associated HCRU and costs were dose-dependent.

	abstract = {Background
Severe asthma occurs more often in older adult patients. We hypothesized that the greater risk for severe asthma in older individuals is due to aging, and is independent of asthma duration.

Methods
This is a cross-sectional study of prospectively collected data from adult participants (N=1130; 454 with severe asthma) enrolled from 2002 – 2011 in the Severe Asthma Research Program.

Results
The association between age and the probability of severe asthma, which was performed by applying a Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoother, revealed an inflection point at age 45 for risk of severe asthma. The probability of severe asthma increased with each year of life until 45 years and thereafter increased at a much slower rate. Asthma duration also increased the probability of severe asthma but had less effect than aging. After adjustment for most comorbidities of aging and for asthma duration using logistic regression, asthmatics older than 45 maintained the greater probability of severe asthma [OR: 2.73 (95 CI: 1.96; 3.81)]. After 45, the age-related risk of severe asthma continued to increase in men, but not in women.

Conclusions
Overall, the impact of age and asthma duration on risk for asthma severity in men and women is greatest over times of 18-45 years of age; age has a greater effect than asthma duration on risk of severe asthma.},

Spirometry examinations followed the 1987 American Thoracic Society recommendations, and the quality of the data was continuously monitored and maintained. Caucasian subjects had higher mean FVC and FEV1 values than did Mexican-American and African-American subjects across the entire age range. However, Caucasian and Mexican-American subjects had similar FVC and FEV1 values with respect to height, and African-American subjects had lower values. These differences may be partially due to differences in body build: observed Mexican-Americans were shorter than Caucasian subjects of the same age, and African-Americans on average have a smaller trunk:leg ratio than do Caucasians. Reference values and lower limits of normal were derived using a piecewise polynomial model with age and height as predictors. These reference values encompass a wide age range for three race/ethnic groups and should prove useful for diagnostic and research purposes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Propensity score matching is a commonly used tool. However, its use in settings with more than two treatment groups has been less frequent. We examined the performance of a recently developed propensity score weighting method in the three-treatment group setting.
METHODS: The matching weight method is an extension of inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) that reweights both exposed and unexposed groups to emulate a propensity score matched population. Matching weights can generalize to multiple treatment groups. The performance of matching weights in the three-group setting was compared via simulation to three-way 1:1:1 propensity score matching and IPTW. We also applied these methods to an empirical example that compared the safety of three analgesics.
RESULTS: Matching weights had similar bias, but better mean squared error (MSE) compared with three-way matching in all scenarios. The benefits were more pronounced in scenarios with a rare outcome, unequally sized treatment groups, or poor covariate overlap. IPTW's performance was highly dependent on covariate overlap. In the empirical example, matching weights achieved the best balance for 24 out of 35 covariates. Hazard ratios were numerically similar to matching. However, the confidence intervals were narrower for matching weights.
CONCLUSIONS: Matching weights demonstrated improved performance over three-way matching in terms of MSE, particularly in simulation scenarios where finding matched subjects was difficult. Given its natural extension to settings with even more than three groups, we recommend matching weights for comparing outcomes across multiple treatment groups, particularly in settings with rare outcomes or unequal exposure distributions.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of administrative databases to perform epidemiological studies in asthma has increased in recent years. The absence of clinical parameters to measure the level of asthma severity and control is a major limitation of database studies. A study was undertaken to develop and validate two database indexes to measure the control and severity of asthma.
METHODS: Database indexes of asthma severity and control were derived from definitions in the Canadian Asthma Consensus Guidelines based on dispensed prescriptions and on medical services recorded in two large administrative databases from the Canadian province of Québec (Régie de l'Assurance Maladie du Québec (RAMQ) and MED-ECHO) over 12 months. The database indexes of asthma severity and control were validated against the pulmonary function test results of 71 patients with asthma randomly selected from two asthma clinics, and they were also applied to a cohort of patients with asthma followed up for 139 283 person-years selected from the RAMQ and MED-ECHO databases between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2004.
RESULTS: According to the database indexes, 49.3\%, 29.6\% and 21.1\% of patients recruited at the asthma clinics were found to have mild, moderate and severe asthma, respectively, while 53.5\% were found to have controlled asthma. The mean predicted value of the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) ranged from 89.8\% for mild asthma to 61.5\% for severe asthma (p{\textless}0.001), whereas the range from controlled to uncontrolled asthma was 89.5\% to 67.3\% (p{\textless}0.001). The ratio of the FEV(1) to the forced vital capacity (FEV(1)/FVC ratio) measured in 56 patients ranged from 75.8\% for mild asthma to 61.8\% for severe asthma (p = 0.030), whereas the range from controlled to uncontrolled asthma was 75.3\% to 65.7\% (p{\textless}0.001).
CONCLUSION: In the absence of clinical data, these database indexes could be used in epidemiological studies to assess the severity and control of asthma.},

No single alternative is best under all conditions examined. The paper provides a straightforward algorithm for choosing among the alternative estimators.

We aim to provide guidance on analysing resource use and costs focusing on randomised trials, although methods often have wider applicability. Twelve broad categories of methods were identified: (I) methods based on the normal distribution, (II) methods following transformation of data, (III) single-distribution generalized linear models (GLMs), (IV) parametric models based on skewed distributions outside the GLM family, (V) models based on mixtures of parametric distributions, (VI) two (or multi)-part and Tobit models, (VII) survival methods, (VIII) non-parametric methods, (IX) methods based on truncation or trimming of data, (X) data components models, (XI) methods based on averaging across models, and (XII) Markov chain methods. Based on this review, our recommendations are that, first, simple methods are preferred in large samples where the near-normality of sample means is assured. Second, in somewhat smaller samples, relatively simple methods, able to deal with one or two of above data characteristics, may be preferable but checking sensitivity to assumptions is necessary. Finally, some more complex methods hold promise, but are relatively untried; their implementation requires substantial expertise and they are not currently recommended for wider applied work.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an eosinophilic phenotype may benefit from treatment with mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin-5.
METHODS: We performed two phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trials comparing mepolizumab (100 mg in METREX, 100 or 300 mg in METREO) with placebo, given as a subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 52 weeks in patients with COPD who had a history of moderate or severe exacerbations while taking inhaled glucocorticoid-based triple maintenance therapy. In METREX, unselected patients in the modified intention-to-treat population with an eosinophilic phenotype were stratified according to blood eosinophil count (≥150 per cubic millimeter at screening or ≥300 per cubic millimeter during the previous year). In METREO, all patients had a blood eosinophil count of at least 150 per cubic millimeter at screening or at least 300 per cubic millimeter during the previous year. The primary end point was the annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations. Safety was also assessed.
RESULTS: In METREX, the mean annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations in the modified intention-to-treat population with an eosinophilic phenotype (462 patients) was 1.40 per year in the mepolizumab group versus 1.71 per year in the placebo group (rate ratio, 0.82; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.98; adjusted P=0.04); no significant between-group differences were found in the overall modified intention-to-treat population (836 patients) (rate ratio, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.85 to 1.12; adjusted P{\textgreater}0.99). In METREO, the mean annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was 1.19 per year in the 100-mg mepolizumab group, 1.27 per year in the 300-mg mepolizumab group, and 1.49 per year in the placebo group. The rate ratios for exacerbations in the 100-mg and 300-mg mepolizumab groups versus the placebo group were 0.80 (95\% CI, 0.65 to 0.98; adjusted P=0.07) and 0.86 (95\% CI, 0.70 to 1.05; adjusted P=0.14), respectively. A greater effect of mepolizumab, as compared with placebo, on the annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was found among patients with higher blood eosinophil counts at screening. The safety profile of mepolizumab was similar to that of placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: Mepolizumab at a dose of 100 mg was associated with a lower annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations than placebo among patients with COPD and an eosinophilic phenotype. This finding suggests that eosinophilic airway inflammation contributes to COPD exacerbations.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of benralizumab, an interleukin-5 receptor alpha-directed cytolytic monoclonal antibody, for the prevention of exacerbations in patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are not known.
METHODS: In the GALATHEA and TERRANOVA trials, we enrolled patients with COPD (at a ratio of approximately 2:1 on the basis of eosinophil count [≥220 per cubic millimeter vs. {\textless}220 per cubic millimeter]) who had frequent exacerbations despite receiving guideline-based inhaled treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to receive benralizumab (30 or 100 mg in GALATHEA; 10, 30, or 100 mg in TERRANOVA) every 8 weeks (every 4 weeks for the first three doses) or placebo. The primary end point was the treatment effect of benralizumab, measured as the annualized COPD exacerbation rate ratio (benralizumab vs. placebo) at week 56 in patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts of 220 per cubic millimeter or greater. Safety was also assessed.
RESULTS: In GALATHEA, the estimates of the annualized exacerbation rate were 1.19 per year (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.36) in the 30-mg benralizumab group, 1.03 per year (95\% CI, 0.90 to 1.19) in the 100-mg benralizumab group, and 1.24 per year (95\% CI, 1.08 to 1.42) in the placebo group; the rate ratio as compared with placebo was 0.96 for 30 mg of benralizumab (P = 0.65) and 0.83 for 100 mg of benralizumab (P = 0.05). In TERRANOVA, the estimates of the annualized exacerbation rate for 10 mg, 30 mg, and 100 mg of benralizumab and for placebo were 0.99 per year (95\% CI, 0.87 to 1.13), 1.21 per year (95\% CI, 1.08 to 1.37), 1.09 per year (95\% CI, 0.96 to 1.23), and 1.17 per year (95\% CI, 1.04 to 1.32), respectively; the corresponding rate ratios were 0.85 (P = 0.06), 1.04 (P = 0.66), and 0.93 (P = 0.40). At 56 weeks, none of the annualized COPD exacerbation rate ratios for any dose of benralizumab as compared with placebo reached significance in either trial. Types and frequencies of adverse events were similar with benralizumab and placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: Add-on benralizumab was not associated with a lower annualized rate of COPD exacerbations than placebo among patients with moderate to very severe COPD, a history of frequent moderate or severe exacerbations, and blood eosinophil counts of 220 per cubic millimeter or greater (Funded by AstraZeneca [GALATHEA and TERRANOVA] and Kyowa Hakko Kirin [GALATHEA]; GALATHEA and TERRANOVA ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT02138916 and NCT02155660.).},

Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder with evolving layers of complexity. It has long been characterised by the classical motor features of parkinsonism associated with Lewy bodies and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. However, the symptomatology of Parkinson's disease is now recognised as heterogeneous, with clinically significant non-motor features. Similarly, its pathology involves extensive regions of the nervous system, various neurotransmitters, and protein aggregates other than just Lewy bodies. The cause of Parkinson's disease remains unknown, but risk of developing Parkinson's disease is no longer viewed as primarily due to environmental factors. Instead, Parkinson's disease seems to result from a complicated interplay of genetic and environmental factors affecting numerous fundamental cellular processes. The complexity of Parkinson's disease is accompanied by clinical challenges, including an inability to make a definitive diagnosis at the earliest stages of the disease and difficulties in the management of symptoms at later stages. Furthermore, there are no treatments that slow the neurodegenerative process. In this Seminar, we review these complexities and challenges of Parkinson's disease.},

	abstract = {Patients assigned the diagnostic ICD-9-CM code for Parkinson’s disease (PD) in an administrative database may not truly carry that diagnosis because of the various error sources. Improved ability to identify PD cases within databases may facilitate specific research goals. Experienced chart reviewers abstracted the working diagnosis of all 577 patients assigned diagnostic code 332.0 (PD) during 1 year at a VA Healthcare System. We then tested the ability of various algorithms making use of PD and non-PD diagnostic codes, specialty of clinics visited, and medication prescription data to predict the abstracted working diagnosis. Chart review determined 436 (75.6\%) patients to be PD or Possibly PD, and 141 (24.4\%) to be Not PD. Our tiered consensus algorithm preferentially used data from specialists over nonspecialists improved PPV to 83.2\% (P = 0.003 vs. baseline). When presence of a PD prescription was an additional criterion, PPV increased further to 88.2\% (P = 0.04 vs. without medication criterion), but sensitivity decreased from 87.4 to 77.1\% (P = 0.0001). We demonstrate that algorithms provide better identification of PD cases than using a single occurrence of the diagnostic code for PD, and modifications of such algorithms can be tuned to maximize parameters that best meet the goals of a particular database query.},

	abstract = {Background The role of long-acting β-agonists (LABA) added to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in the management of asthma is extensively debated. We thought to assess the risk of asthma-related hospitalisation in individuals who regularly filled prescriptions for ICS+LABA compared to those who regularly filled prescriptions for ICS alone or LABA alone, and compared to those who did not regularly fill such medications.
Methods Using administrative health databases of the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, from 1997 to 2012, we conducted a nested case-control analysis of a cohort of asthma patients. Cases were defined as those who experienced asthma-related hospitalisation after the first year of their entry into the cohort. For each case, up to 20 controls were matched based on age, sex, date of cohort entry, and several measures of asthma severity. We categorised individuals as regularly exposed, irregularly exposed, or non-exposed to ICS alone, LABA alone, or ICS+LABA based on dispensation records in the past 12 months. The primary outcome measures were the rate ratio (RR) of the asthma-related hospitalisation among categories of regular exposure.
Results 3319 cases were matched to 43 023 controls. The RR for regular dispensation of ICS+LABA was 1.14 (95\% CI 0.93 to 1.41) compared with regular dispensation of ICS alone and 0.45 (95\% CI 0.29 to 0.70) compared with regular dispensation of LABA alone. Those who regularly dispensed LABA had to dispense an ICS for at least three quarters of a year to reduce their risk to that of those who did not dispense LABA.
Conclusions Regular dispensation of ICS+LABA was not associated with an increased risk of asthma-related hospitalisation compared with regular dispensation of ICS alone. Adherence to ICS in patients who regularly receive ICS+LABA seems to be an important factor in the prevention of adverse asthma-related outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background
Understanding factors associated with the inappropriate or excessive use of short-acting beta agonists (SABA) can help develop better policies.

Methods
We used British Columbian (BC)‘s administrative health data (1997–2014) to create a retrospective cohort of asthma patients aged between 14 and 55 years. The primary and secondary outcomes were, respectively, inappropriate and excessive use of SABA based on a previously validated definition. Exposures were categorised into groups comprising socio-demographic variables, indicators of type and quality of asthma care, and burden of comorbid conditions.

Results
343,520 individuals (56.3\% female, average age 30.5) satisfied the asthma case definition, contributing 2.6 million person-years. 7.3\% of person-years were categorised as inappropriate SABA use and 0.9\% as excessive use. Several factors were associated with lower likelihood of inappropriate use, including female sex, higher socio-economic status, higher continuity of care, having received pulmonary function test in the previous year, visited a specialist in the previous year, and the use of inhaled corticosteroids in the previous year. An asthma-related outpatient visit to a general practitioner in the previous year was associated with a higher likelihood of inappropriate SABA use. Similar associations were found for excessive SABA use with the exception that visit to respirologist and the use of systemic corticosteroids were associated with increased likelihood of excessive use.

Conclusions
Despite proven safety issues, inappropriate SABA use is still prevalent. Several factors belonging to patients’ characteristics and type/quality of care were associated with inappropriate use of SABAs and can be used to risk-stratify patients for targeted attempts to reduce this preventable cause of adverse asthma outcomes.

The coexistence of beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors in the heart clearly indicates that beta(2)-agonists do have some effect on the heart, even when they are highly selective. It should also be taken into account that the beta(2)-agonists utilised in clinical practice have differing selectivities and potencies. beta(2)-agonist use has, in effect, been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. Moreover, patients who have either asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may be at increased risk of cardiovascular complications because these diseases amplify the impact of these agents on the heart and, unfortunately, are a confounding factor when the impact of beta(2)-agonists on the heart is evaluated. Whatever the case may be, this effect is of particular concern for those patients with underlying cardiac conditions. Therefore, beta(2)-agonists must always be used with caution in patients with cardiopathies because these agents may precipitate the concomitant cardiac disease.},

	abstract = {Elucidating the risk of Parkinson's disease
High expression of the α-synuclein gene (SNCA) is a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), but certain drugs may mitigate this risk. Mittal et al. ran a small-molecule screen to identify compounds that regulate levels of SNCA expression and found that several β2-adrenoreceptor (β2AR) agonists reduced them (see the Perspective by Snyder). These compounds modulated epigenetic marks at the SNCA gene, effectively suppressing SNCA transcription. The authors looked at the pharmaceutical history of more than 4 million Norwegians over an 11-year period and found a reduced risk of PD among those that were taking one of the β2AR agonists for other medical problems.
Science, this issue p. 891; see also p. 869
Copy number mutations implicate excess production of α-synuclein as a possibly causative factor in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Using an unbiased screen targeting endogenous gene expression, we discovered that the β2-adrenoreceptor (β2AR) is a regulator of the α-synuclein gene (SNCA). β2AR ligands modulate SNCA transcription through histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation of its promoter and enhancers. Over 11 years of follow-up in 4 million Norwegians, the β2AR agonist salbutamol, a brain-penetrant asthma medication, was associated with reduced risk of developing PD (rate ratio, 0.66; 95\% confidence interval, 0.58 to 0.76). Conversely, a β2AR antagonist correlated with increased risk. β2AR activation protected model mice and patient-derived cells. Thus, β2AR is linked to transcription of α-synuclein and risk of PD in a ligand-specific fashion and constitutes a potential target for therapies.
Regulating the transcription of α-synuclein may constitute a potential target for therapeutic intervention in Parkinson’s disease.

We sought to synthesize studies on the prevalence of PD to obtain an overall view of how the prevalence of this disease varies by age, by sex, and by geographic location.

Geographic location was stratified by the following groups: 1) Asia, 2) Africa, 3) South America, and 4) Europe/North America/Australia. Meta-regression was used to determine whether a significant difference was present between groups. Forty-seven studies were included in the analysis. Meta-analysis of the worldwide data showed a rising prevalence of PD with age (all per 100,000): 41 in 40 to 49 years; 107 in 50 to 59 years; 173 in 55 to 64 years; 428 in 60 to 69 years; 425 in 65 to 74 years; 1087 in 70 to 79 years; and 1903 in older than age 80.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Propensity score matching is a commonly used tool. However, its use in settings with more than two treatment groups has been less frequent. We examined the performance of a recently developed propensity score weighting method in the three treatment group setting.

METHODS
The matching weight method is an extension of inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) that reweights both exposed and unexposed groups to emulate a propensity score matched population. Matching weights can generalize to multiple treatment groups. The performance of matching weights in the three-group setting was compared via simulation to three-way 1:1:1 propensity score matching and IPTW. We also applied these methods to an empirical example that compared the safety of three analgesics.

RESULTS
Matching weights had similar bias, but better mean squared error (MSE) compared to three-way matching in all scenarios. The benefits were more pronounced in scenarios with a rare outcome, unequally sized treatment groups, or poor covariate overlap. IPTW’s performance was highly dependent on covariate overlap. In the empirical example, matching weights achieved the best balance for 24 out of 35 covariates. Hazard ratios were numerically similar to matching. However, the confidence intervals were narrower for matching weights.

CONCLUSIONS
Matching weights demonstrated improved performance over three-way matching in terms of MSE, particularly in simulation scenarios where finding matched subjects was difficult. Given its natural extension to settings with even more than three groups, we recommend matching weights for comparing outcomes across multiple treatment groups, particularly in settings with rare outcomes or unequal exposure distributions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Occurrence of severe asthma exacerbations are the cornerstone of the evaluation of asthma management, but severe asthma exacerbations are rare events. Therefore, trials that assess drug efficacy on exacerbations are done late in clinical development programmes. We aimed to establish an endpoint capturing clinically relevant deteriorations (diary events) that, when combined with severe exacerbations, create a composite outcome (CompEx). CompEx needs to strongly mirror results seen with the severe exacerbation-validated outcome, to allow the design of clinical trials of shorter duration and that include fewer patients than trials assessing severe exacerbations.
METHODS: Data from 12 asthma trials of 6 months or 12 months duration and, with standardised collection of exacerbations and diary card variables, were used to construct and test CompEx. The study populations had a mean age of 35-53 years, 59-69\% were female, and had a mean FEV1 percentage of predicted normal of 63-84\%. With data from five trials, we established a series of diary events based on peak expiratory flow (P), reliever use (R), symptoms (S), awakenings (A), and threshold values for change from baseline and slopes to assess trends. For the development phase, we evaluated different variable combinations and deterioration criteria to select the most robust algorithm to define a diary event for the composite outcome. We defined a composite outcome, CompEx, as first occurrence of a diary event or a severe exacerbation. We assessed the performance of CompEx in seven trials by comparing the event frequency, treatment effect (hazard ratio; HR), and the sample size needed for future trials for the CompEx versus episodes of severe exacerbations.
FINDINGS: CompEx (based on PRS) was the algorithm that best fulfilled our two-set criteria. When censored at 3 months, CompEx resulted in 2·8 times more events than severe exacerbations, and while preserving the treatment effect observed on severe exacerbations (CompEx over severe exacerbation average HR 1·01). The increased number of events, together with the sustained treatment effect, resulted in a large net gain in power, with a 67\% mean reduction in the number of patients required in a drug trial for severe exacerbations. In six of seven comparisons tested, CompEx reduced the sample size needed by at least 50\%. Validation of independent test populations confirmed the ability of CompEx to increase event frequencies, preserve treatment effect, and reduce the number of patients needed.
INTERPRETATION: CompEx is a composite outcome for evaluation of new asthma therapies. CompEx allows design of shorter trials that require fewer patients than studies of severe exacerbations, while preserving the ability to show a treatment effect compared with severe exacerbations.

	abstract = {The use of evidence from clinical trials to support decisions for individual patients is a form of “reference class forecasting”: implicit predictions for an individual are made on the basis of outcomes in a reference class of “similar” patients treated with alternative therapies. Evidence based medicine has generally emphasized the broad reference class of patients qualifying for a trial. Yet patients in a trial (and in clinical practice) differ from one another in many ways that can affect the outcome of interest and the potential for benefit. The central goal of personalized medicine, in its various forms, is to narrow the reference class to yield more patient specific effect estimates to support more individualized clinical decision making. This article will review fundamental conceptual problems with the prediction of outcome risk and heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE), as well as the limitations of conventional (one-variable-at-a-time) subgroup analysis. It will also discuss several regression based approaches to “predictive” heterogeneity of treatment effect analysis, including analyses based on “risk modeling” (such as stratifying trial populations by their risk of the primary outcome or their risk of serious treatment-related harms) and analysis based on “effect modeling” (which incorporates modifiers of relative effect). It will illustrate these approaches with clinical examples and discuss their respective strengths and vulnerabilities.},

Caucasian subjects had higher mean FVC and FEV1 values than did Mexican-American and African-American subjects across the entire age range. However, Caucasian and  Mexican-American subjects had similar FVC and FEV1 values with respect to height, and African-American subjects had lower values. These differences may be partially due to differences in body  build: observed Mexican-Americans were shorter than Caucasian subjects of the same age, and African-Americans on average have a smaller trunk:leg ratio than do Caucasians. Reference values and  lower limits of normal were derived using a piecewise polynomial model with age and height as predictors. These reference values encompass a wide age range for three race/ethnic groups and should  prove useful for diagnostic and research purposes.},

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined based on a reduced ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) on spirometry. However, within this definition, there is significant heterogeneity of pathophysiological processes that lead to airflow obstruction and variation in phenotypic manifestations across patients. Current pharmacological treatments are based on large randomised clinical trials that apply to an “average” patient. Precision health enables tailoring of treatment for each individual patient by taking into account their unique characteristics. The number needed to treat (NNT) metric is often used to define implementation of precision health for specific interventions, with common endpoints requiring an NNT ≤ 5 to achieve precision therapy. Higher NNTs may be acceptable for rare but important endpoints such as mortality. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists and inhaled corticosteroids, which are commonly used in COPD, have 1-year treatment NNTs between 15 and 20 for exacerbation prevention in unselected patients with COPD. Subgroup identification using biomarkers or clinical traits may enable precision health. For example, NNT for inhaled corticosteroids is 9 in patients with a blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells/μL and 8 for long-acting muscarinic antagonists in patients with a body mass index ≤ 20 kg/m2. Lung volume reduction surgery is associated with an NNT of 6 for survival over 5 years in patients with upper lobe-predominant disease and low exercise capacity (whereas the NNT is 245 when no bioimaging or exercise markers are used). Continuous domiciliary oxygen therapy (for at least 15 hours/day) has an NNT of 5 for survival over 5 years in patients with resting hypoxemia (PaO2 {\textless} 60 mmHg on room air). Emerging areas of precision health in COPD with potential for low NNTs in specific circumstances include anti-interleukin-5 therapy for eosinophilic COPD, and immunoglobulin replacement therapy for patients with severe immunoglobulin deficiency.},

Task Force members conducted focused reviews of the literature on relevant topics, advised by a methodologist. It is well established that nutritional status, and in particular abnormal body composition, is an important independent determinant of COPD outcome. The Task Force identified different metabolic phenotypes of COPD as a basis for nutritional risk profile assessment that is useful in clinical trial design and patient counselling. Nutritional intervention is probably effective in undernourished patients and probably most when combined with an exercise programme. Providing evidence of cost-effectiveness of nutritional intervention is required to support reimbursement and thus increase access to nutritional intervention. Overall, the evidence indicates that a well-balanced diet is beneficial to all COPD patients, not only for its potential pulmonary benefits, but also for its proven benefits in metabolic and cardiovascular risk.},

	abstract = {Summary
Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are episodes of worsening of symptoms, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. COPD exacerbations are associated with increased airway and systemic inflammation and physiological changes, especially the development of hyperinflation. They are triggered mainly by respiratory viruses and bacteria, which infect the lower airway and increase airway inflammation. Some patients are particularly susceptible to exacerbations, and show worse health status and faster disease progression than those who have infrequent exacerbations. Several pharmacological interventions are effective for the reduction of exacerbation frequency and severity in COPD such as inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators, and their combinations. Non-pharmacological therapies such as pulmonary rehabilitation, self-management, and home ventilatory support are becoming increasingly important, but still need to be studied in controlled trials. The future of exacerbation prevention is in assessment of optimum combinations of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies that will result in improvement of health status, and reduction of hospital admission and mortality associated with COPD.},

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) continues to be an important cause of morbidity, mortality, and health-care costs worldwide. It is a global health issue, with cigarette smoking being an important risk factor universally; other factors, such as exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution, occupational hazards, and infections, are also important. As the global population ages, the burden of COPD will increase in years to come. Prevalence estimates of the disorder show considerable variability across populations, suggesting that risk factors can affect populations differently. Other advances in our understanding of COPD are increased recognition of the importance of comorbid disease, identification of different COPD phenotypes, and understanding how factors other than lung function affect outcome in our patients. The challenge we will all face in the next few years will be implementation of cost-effective prevention and management strategies to stem the tide of this disease and its cost.},

A total of 11 459 measurements of weight and height from 719 participants were used, obtained from the EPITeen cohort at 13, 17, and 21 years, and extracted from child health books. The individual growth curves were modeled using mixed-effects polynomial, fractional polynomial, and linear splines, and each model parameterization included as covariate age or height. The goodness-of-fit of the model parametrizations was compared using the relative squared error (RSE) and the relative absolute error (RAE). The adjustment of weight-for-height as denoted by BMI was found to be biased, especially for extreme values of height and presented the worst fit indexes from all model parameterizations tested (RSE = 12.46\%; RAE = 22.63\%). Regardless of the smoothing method, the weight-for-height retrieved the best fit indexes in comparison to the adjustment for age. With regard to the smoothing methods and comparing weight-for-height model parameterizations, the fractional polynomial model performed better (RSE = 0.75\%; RAE = 5.70\%), followed by linear splines (RSE = 0.77\%; RAE = 5.82\%), and conventional polynomial (RSE = 0.91\%; RAE = 6.82\%). Therefore, growth modeling in pediatric age should be based on the modeling of weight-for-height because the use of BMI leaves residual confounding for height. Regarding the smoothing methods, although differences were relatively small, the fractional polynomials performed better in comparison to conventional polynomials and linear splines.},

Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

The Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies was followed when extracting data and appraising the selected studies. Of the 4,481 records identified, 30 articles were selected for full-text review, and only four of these were eligible to be included in the review. The only consistent predictor across all four models was a measure of smoking. Sex and age were used in most models; however, other factors varied widely. Two of the models had good ability to discriminate between people who were correctly or incorrectly classified as at risk of developing COPD. Overall none of the models were particularly useful in accurately predicting future risk of COPD, nor were they good at ruling out future risk of COPD. Further studies are needed to develop new prediction models and robustly validate them in external cohorts.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is uncertain whether long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), widely used to treat COPD, increases the risk of fracture, particularly in women, in view of the postmenopausal risks. We assessed whether long-term ICS use in patients with COPD increases the risk of hip or upper extremity fractures, and examined sex-related differences.
METHODS: The Quebec health-care databases were used to form a cohort of patients with COPD over 1990 to 2005, followed until 2007 for the first hip or upper extremity fracture. In a nested case-control analysis, each case of fracture was matched with 20 control subjects on age, sex, and follow-up time. The adjusted rate ratio (RR) of fracture with ICS use, by duration and dose, was estimated using conditional logistic regression, with an interaction term to compare the risk in men and women.
RESULTS: In the cohort of 240,110 subjects, 19,396 sustained a fracture during a mean 5.3 years (rate, 15.2 per 1,000 per year). Any use of ICSs was not associated with an increased rate of fracture (RR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.97-1.03). The fracture rate was increased with {\textgreater} 4 years of ICS use at daily doses ≥ 1,000 μg in fluticasone equivalents (RR, 1.10; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.19). This risk increase did not differ between men and women.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term ICS use at high doses is associated with a modest increase in the risk of hip and upper extremity fractures in patients with COPD. This dose-duration risk increase does not appear to be higher for women.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blood eosinophil counts might predict response to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a history of exacerbations. We used data from the WISDOM trial to assess whether patients with COPD with higher blood eosinophil counts would be more likely to have exacerbations if ICS treatment was withdrawn.
METHODS: WISDOM was a 12-month, randomised, parallel-group trial in which patients received 18 μg tiotropium, 100 μg salmeterol, and 1000 μg fluticasone propionate daily for 6 weeks and were then randomly assigned (1:1) electronically to receive either continued or reduced ICS over 12 weeks. We did a post-hoc analysis after complete ICS withdrawal (months 3-12) to compare rate of exacerbations and time to exacerbation outcomes on the basis of blood eosinophil subgroups of increasing cutoff levels. The WISDOM trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00975195.
FINDINGS: In the 2296 patients receiving treatment after ICS withdrawal, moderate or severe exacerbation rate was higher in the ICS-withdrawal group versus the ICS-continuation group in patients with eosinophil counts (out of total white blood cell count) of 2\% or greater (rate ratio 1·22 [95\% CI 1·02-1·48]), 4\% or greater (1·63 [1·19-2·24]), and 5\% or greater (1·82 [1·20-2·76]). The increase in exacerbation rate became more pronounced as the eosinophil cutoff level rose, with significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction reached for 4\% and 5\% only. Similar results were seen with eosinophil cutoffs of 300 cells per μL and 400 cells per μL, and mutually exclusive subgroups.
INTERPRETATION: Blood eosinophil counts at screening were related to the exacerbation rate after complete ICS withdrawal in patients with severe to very severe COPD and a history of exacerbations. Our data suggest that counts of 4\% or greater or 300 cells per μL or more might identify a deleterious effect of ICS withdrawal, an effect not seen in most patients with eosinophil counts below these thresholds.

Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration., Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision–analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions., We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n=544 for model development, n=273 for external validation)., We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for making clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.},

Weight loss in COPD is a consequence of increased energy requirements unbalanced by dietary intake. Both metabolic and mechanical inefficiency contribute to the elevated energy expenditure. A disbalance between protein synthesis and protein breakdown may cause a disproportionate depletion of fat-free mass in some patients. Nutritional support is indicated for depleted patients with COPD because it provides not only supportive care, but direct intervention through improvement in respiratory and peripheral skeletal muscle function and in exercise performance. A combination of oral nutritional supplements and exercise or anabolic stimulus appears to be the best treatment approach to obtaining significant functional improvement. Patients responding to this treatment even demonstrated a decreased mortality. Poor response was related to the effects of systemic inflammation on dietary intake and catabolism.

	abstract = {The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in women is increasing, as is hospitalization for COPD. The number of women dying of COPD in the United States now surpasses men. Despite this, research suggests that physicians are still more likely to correctly diagnose men with COPD than women. Increased tobacco use in women likely explains some of the increase in the prevalence of COPD in women, but data suggest that women may actually be at greater risk of smoking-induced lung function impairment, more severe dyspnea, and poorer health status for the same level of tobacco exposure. The degree to which these observations represent biologic, physiologic, or sociologic differences is not known. Nonsmokers with COPD are also more likely to be female. In addition, new evidence is emerging that men and women may be phenotypically different in their response to tobacco smoke, with men being more prone to an emphysematous phenotype and women an airway predominant phenotype. Inasmuch as COPD is a disease of inflammation, it is also possible that sexual dimorphism of the human immune response may also be responsible for gender differences in the disease. More data are still needed on what the implications of these findings are on therapy. In this clinical commentary, we present current knowledge regarding how gender influences the epidemiology, diagnosis, and presentation of COPD in addition to physiologic and psychologic impairments and we attempt to offer insight into why these differences might exist and how this may influence therapeutic management.},

These materials were discussed in a sponsored workshop (Toward a Research Agenda on Gender and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) held in Vancouver, Canada, in 2007, engaging a variety of scientists and stakeholders in assessing the issues and emergent questions. The goal of this workshop was to foster the advancement of a research agenda that more tightly links tobacco, COPD, and lung health and that reflects and investigates sex and gender issues, especially in reference to the growing rates of COPD among women. A research agenda for consideration by researchers in the fields of women's health, medicine, tobacco use, COPD, and related fields is offered.},

	abstract = {Background
The rate of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) decline ("beta") is a marker of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease risk. The reduction in beta after quitting smoking is an upper limit for the reduction achievable from switching to novel nicotine delivery products. We review available evidence to estimate this reduction and quantify the relationship of smoking to beta.

Methods
Studies were identified, in healthy individuals or patients with respiratory disease, that provided data on beta over at least 2 years of follow-up, separately for those who gave up smoking and other smoking groups. Publications to June 2010 were considered. Independent beta estimates were derived for four main smoking groups: never smokers, ex-smokers (before baseline), quitters (during follow-up) and continuing smokers. Unweighted and inverse variance-weighted regression analyses compared betas in the smoking groups, and in continuing smokers by amount smoked, and estimated whether beta or beta differences between smoking groups varied by age, sex and other factors.

Results
Forty-seven studies had relevant data, 28 for both sexes and 19 for males. Sixteen studies started before 1970. Mean follow-up was 11 years. On the basis of weighted analysis of 303 betas for the four smoking groups, never smokers had a beta 10.8 mL/yr (95\% confidence interval (CI), 8.9 to 12.8) less than continuing smokers. Betas for ex-smokers were 12.4 mL/yr (95\% CI, 10.1 to 14.7) less than for continuing smokers, and for quitters, 8.5 mL/yr (95\% CI, 5.6 to 11.4) less. These betas were similar to that for never smokers. In continuing smokers, beta increased 0.33 mL/yr per cigarette/day. Beta differences between continuing smokers and those who gave up were greater in patients with respiratory disease or with reduced baseline lung function, but were not clearly related to age or sex.

Conclusion
The available data have numerous limitations, but clearly show that continuing smokers have a beta that is dose-related and over 10 mL/yr greater than in never smokers, ex-smokers or quitters. The greater decline in those with respiratory disease or reduced lung function is consistent with some smokers having a more rapid rate of FEV1 decline. These results help in designing studies comparing continuing smokers of conventional cigarettes and switchers to novel products.},

However, being overweight or obese has been associated with a better prognosis in subjects suffering from chronic diseases, id est the "obesity paradox". In both community-dwelling and hospitalized patients with COPD, several studies have reported a significant protective effect of obesity on all-cause mortality, indicating that also in obstructive pulmonary diseases, an obesity paradox may be present. Interestingly, the "paradox" is more evident for subjects with severe bronchial obstruction (i.e., a lower FEV1), while in mild-moderate conditions, the weight-related mortality shows a behavior similar to that observed in the general population. Several factors may confound the relation between COPD, obesity and mortality. The lower FEV1 found in obese people may be linked to a restrictive defect rather than to an obstructive one. Due to the modified chest wall mechanical properties-related to increased fat mass-obese COPD patients may present, respect to their lean counterpart, a lower lung hyperinflation which is associated with higher mortality. The traditional classification of COPD attributes to obese "blue bloaters" a low-grade emphysema in opposition to lean "pink puffers"; the fact that emphysema extent is related to mortality may bias the relationship between weight and survival. It is also to underline that the majority of the studies, consider BMI rather than body composition (a better predictor of mortality) when studying the intriguing relation between weight, COPD, and mortality. Reverse bias has also to be taken into account, hypothesizing that an unintentional weight loss may be the deleterious factor related to mortality, rather than considering obesity a protective one. Further prospective studies are needed to shed light on the complexity of this emerging issue.

	abstract = {Background
Epidemiologic studies that aim to estimate a causal effect of an exposure on a particular event of interest may be complicated by the existence of competing events that preclude the occurrence of the primary event. Recently, many articles have been published in the epidemiologic literature demonstrating the need for appropriate models to accommodate competing risks when they are present. However, there has been little attention to variable selection for confounder control in competing risk analyses.

Methods
We employ simulation to demonstrate the bias in two variable selection strategies: include covariates that are associated with the exposure and 1) which change the cause-specific hazard of any of the outcomes; or 2) which change the cause-specific hazard of the specific event of interest.

Results
We demonstrated minimal to no bias in estimators adjusted for confounders of exposure and either the event of interest or the competing event, but bias of varying magnitude in almost all estimators adjusted only for confounders of exposure and the primary outcome.

Discussion
When estimating causal effects for which there are competing risks, the analysis should control for confounders of both the exposure–primary outcome effect and of the exposure–competing outcome effect.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: β2-adrenoreceptors have recently been identified as regulators of the α-synuclein gene, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to assess the association between use of β2-agonists and β-antagonists and the risk of developing PD.
METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study in a cohort of 1,762,164 adults without a diagnosis of PD. They were identified on January, 1, 2004, from the electronic medical records of the largest health care provider in Israel. Participants were followed up until June 30, 2017, for the occurrence of PD. Ten randomly selected controls were matched to each case of PD on age, sex, ethnic group, and duration of follow-up.
RESULTS: During follow-up 11,314 patients were newly diagnosed with PD and were matched with 113,140 controls. An increased risk of PD was seen with the use of nonselective β-antagonists (RR, 2.04 [1.90-2.20]) but not with the use of selective β1-antagonists (RR, 1.00 [0.95-1.05]). Use of β2-agonists was associated with reduced risk of PD (RR, 0.89 [0.82-0.96] for short-acting; RR, 0.84 [0.76-0.93] for long-acting; and RR, 0.49 [0.25-0.92] for ultra-long-acting β2-agonists). In an analysis of individual drugs, propranolol and salbutamol were significantly associated with PD risk, even when these drugs were ascertained 5 years prior to the index date, compared with nonusers (RR, 1.31 [1.08-1.58] and 1.89 \{\vphantom{\}}1.53-2.33]) in patients who filled {\textless}6 and ≥6 propranolol prescriptions, respectively; the corresponding RRs for salbutamol were 0.95 (0.83-1.08) and 0.65 (0.45-0.94), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of propranolol appears to be associated with an increased risk of PD, whereas use of β2-agonists is associated with a decreased risk of PD. © 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.},

METHODS: We summarize the strongest evidence available, using data from the United States or from other developed countries when US data were insufficient.
RESULTS: For some disorders, prevalence is a better descriptor of impact; for others, incidence is preferable. Per 1,000 children, estimated prevalence was 5.8 for autism spectrum disorder and 2.4 for cerebral palsy; for Tourette syndrome, the data were insufficient. In the general population, per 1,000, the 1-year prevalence for migraine was 121, 7.1 for epilepsy, and 0.9 for multiple sclerosis. Among the elderly, the prevalence of Alzheimer disease was 67 and that of Parkinson disease was 9.5. For diseases best described by annual incidence per 100,000, the rate for stroke was 183, 101 for major traumatic brain injury, 4.5 for spinal cord injury, and 1.6 for ALS.

Cognitive impairment is common in people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic heart failure (CHF); however, accurate estimates of prevalence are lacking. To date, there are no meta-analyses that have specifically investigated prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in this particular population. Our aim was to undertake a systematic review and apply meta-analytic methods to estimate the prevalence of MCI and any cognitive impairment (ACI) in people with COPD and CHF.
Methods
We identified relevant studies for COPD and CHF by searching the published literature from inception to February 2016 using the MEDLINE and Web of Science databases. Studies were included if they documented the prevalence of MCI and/or cognitive impairment for COPD and CHF patients without dementia.
Results
Seventeen studies including people with CHF (n = 29,456) and 14 studies including people with COPD (n = 23,116) were included. The pooled mean age for COPD was 66.3 years and for CHF, 75.6 years. The pooled prevalence of MCI in the COPD was 25\% (95\% CI: 23\%, 42\%) and ACI, 32\% (95\% CI: 18\%, 38\%). Correspondingly, the pooled prevalence of MCI in those with CHF was 32\% (95\% CI: 22\%, 43\%) and ACI, 31\% (95\% CI: 23\%, 40\%).
Conclusions
One in 4 people with COPD and 1 in 3 people with CHF had MCI, respectively. The overall prevalence of ACI for COPD was 32\% and for CHF, 31\%. Future work should consider ways of detecting, managing, or improving cognitive function and other cognition-related outcomes in this group of people.},

This study comprehensively examined the impact of comorbidities on excess direct medical costs in COPD patients.From health administrative data in British Columbia, Canada (1996-2012), we created a propensity-score-matched cohort of incident COPD patients and individuals without COPD. Health services use records were compiled into 16 major disease categories based on International Classification of Diseases codes. Excess costs (in 2015 Canadian dollars and converted to 2015 Euros; CAD1.000=EUR 0.706) were estimated as the adjusted difference in direct medical costs between the two groups.The sample included 128 424 subjects in each group. COPD patients generated excess costs of CAD5196/EUR3668 per person-year (95\% CI CAD3540-8529), of which 26\% was attributable to COPD itself and 51\% was attributable to comorbidities (the remaining 23\% could not be attributed to any specific condition). The major cost driver was excess hospitalisation costs. The largest components of comorbidity costs were circulatory diseases, other respiratory disorders, digestive disorders and psychological disorders (CAD696/EUR491, CAD312/EUR220, CAD274/EUR193 and CAD249/EUR176 per person-year, respectively).These findings suggest that the prevention and appropriate management of comorbidities in COPD patients may effectively reduce the overall burden of COPD.},

	abstract = {β2-Agonists are effective bronchodilators due primarily to their ability to relax airway smooth muscle (ASM). They exert their effects via their binding to the active site of β2-adrenoceptors on ASM, which triggers a signaling cascade that results in a number of events, all of which contribute to relaxation of ASM. There are some differences between β2-agonists. Traditional inhaled short-acting β2-agonists albuterol, fenoterol, and terbutaline provide rapid as-needed symptom relief and short-term prophylactic protection against bronchoconstriction induced by exercise or other stimuli. The twice-daily β2-agonists formoterol and salmeterol represent important advances. Their effective bronchodilating properties and long-term improvement in lung function offer considerable clinical benefits to patients. More recently, a newer β2-agonist (indacaterol) with a longer pharmacodynamic half-life has been discovered, with the hopes of achieving once-daily dosing. In general, β2-agonists have an acceptable safety profile, although there is still controversy as to whether long-acting β2-agonists may increase the risk of asthma mortality. In any case, they can induce adverse effects, such as increased heart rate, palpitations, transient decrease in PaO2, and tremor. Desensitization of β2-adrenoceptors that occurs during the first few days of regular use of β2-agonist treatment may account for the commonly observed resolution of the majority of these adverse events after the first few doses. Nevertheless, it can also induce tolerance to bronchoprotective effects of β2-agonists and has the potential to reduce bronchodilator sensitivity to them. Some novel once-daily β2-agonists (olodaterol, vilanterol, abediterol) are under development, mainly in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid or a long-acting antimuscarinic agent.},

A random sample from the general population (undiagnosed subjects) was screened for symptoms and objective signs of COPD (n=1,155). The lung function of subjects with symptoms of COPD was monitored for 6 months. During this period, 48 new COPD patients with a persistently reduced lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) less than or equal to the predicted value minus 2 SD) were detected. A disease-specific quality-of-life questionnaire (chronic respiratory questionnaire (CRQ)) was administered and clinical and GP consultation data were collected. Multivariate analysis showed that quality-of-life impairments due to dyspnoea and fatigue and variability in lung function (bronchial hyperresponsiveness, reversibility and peak expiratory flow rate variability) were related to medical consultation. Only 31\% of the newly detected patients reported that they had ever visited their GP for respiratory complaints. A similarly low percentage was found in the rest of the sample (26\%). It is concluded that the mere presence of respiratory symptoms or a (gradually) reduced lung function is insufficient reason for patients to seek medical help. Subjects are more likely to consult their general practitioner once their quality of everyday life is affected or they experience variability in lung function.},

	abstract = {Only long-term home oxygen therapy has been shown in randomised controlled trials to increase survival in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There have been no trials assessing the effect of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators, alone or in combination, on mortality in patients with COPD, despite their known benefit in reducing symptoms and exacerbations. The “TOwards a Revolution in COPD Health” (TORCH) survival study is aiming to determine the impact of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (SFC) combination and the individual components on the survival of COPD patients.
TORCH is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study. Approximately 6,200 patients with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomly assigned to b.i.d. treatment with either SFC (50/500 µg), fluticasone propionate (500 µg), salmeterol (50 µg) or placebo for 3 yrs. The primary end-point is all-cause mortality; secondary end-points are COPD morbidity relating to rate of exacerbations and health status, using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire. Other end-points include other mortality and exacerbation end-points, requirement for long-term oxygen therapy, and clinic lung function. Safety end-points include adverse events, with additional information on bone fractures.
The first patient was recruited in September 2000 and results should be available in 2006. This paper describes the “TOwards a Revolution in COPD Health” study and explains the rationale behind it.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate prediction of exacerbation risk enables personalised care for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We developed and validated a generalisable model to predict individualised rate and severity of COPD exacerbations.
METHODS: In this risk modelling study, we pooled data from three COPD trials on patients with a history of exacerbations. We developed a mixed-effect model to predict exacerbations over 1 year. Severe exacerbations were those requiring inpatient care. Predictors were history of exacerbations, age, sex, body-mass index, smoking status, domiciliary oxygen therapy, lung function, symptom burden, and current medication use. Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End-points (ECLIPSE), a multicentre cohort study, was used for external validation.
RESULTS: The development dataset included 2380 patients, 1373 (58\%) of whom were men. Mean age was 64·7 years (SD 8·8). Mean exacerbation rate was 1·42 events per year and 0·29 events per year were severe. When validated against all patients with COPD in ECLIPSE (mean exacerbation rate was 1·20 events per year, 0·27 events per year were severe), the area-under-curve (AUC) was 0·81 (95\% CI 0·79-0·83) for at least two exacerbations and 0·77 (95\% CI 0·74-0·80) for at least one severe exacerbation. Predicted exacerbation and observed exacerbation rates were similar (1·31 events per year for all exacerbations and 0·25 events per year for severe exacerbations vs 1·20 events per year and 0·27 events per year). In ECLIPSE, in patients with previous exacerbation history (mean exacerbation rate was 1·82 events per year, 0·40 events per year were severe), AUC was 0·73 (95\% CI 0·70-0·76) for two or more exacerbations and 0·74 (95\% CI 0·70-0·78) for at least one severe exacerbation. Calibration was accurate for severe exacerbations (predicted 0·37 events per year vs observed 0·40 events per year) and all exacerbations (predicted 1·80 events per year vs observed 1·82 events per year).
INTERPRETATION: This model can be used as a decision tool to personalise COPD treatment and prevent exacerbations.

African-American children were less likely to have made an office visit for asthma; the adjusted OR was 0.48 (95\% CI, 0.26 to 0.85).

Furthermore, these children appear to make disproportionately few office visits for asthma, suggesting suboptimal use of preventive services for asthma. In contrast, the comparable use of well-child visits in the two groups suggests the problem may not be in access to care in general, but there may be specific problems in the successful management of chronic diseases such as asthma among African-American children.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}(\textit{JAMA}. 1995;274:469-473){\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that is widespread throughout the US population and disproportionately affects children. This literature review aimed to identify recent information regarding the economic burden of pediatric asthma in the US. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Econlit, and PsycINFO databases and gray literature sources were searched from January 2012 to January 2018 to capture relevant publications. Publications reporting on healthcare resource utilization and/or healthcare costs of pediatric asthma were included (n = 8). Total direct costs of pediatric asthma were US\$5.92 billion in 2013. Average annual costs per child ranged from US\$3076 to US\$13612. Across studies, pharmacy (US\$1027–2120), inpatient (US\$337–2016) and outpatient (US\$1049–8039) costs were the primary contributors to healthcare costs. Inpatient and emergency department (ED) visits exerted a high economic burden. For instance, the national annual cost of asthma-related hospitalizations was estimated at US\$1.59 billion in 2009, while estimates of costs-per-hospitalization (2010) and charges-per-discharge (2009) were US\$3600 and US\$8406, respectively. The total cost of ED visits to Medicaid was estimated at US\$272 million in 2010. In a mixed-insurance population, ED cost estimates ranged from US\$152 to US\$172 annually per patient. Invariably, costs for children with asthma were significantly greater than for children without. Pediatric asthma imposes a significant economic burden to the US healthcare system. Children with asthma have significantly higher healthcare resource utilization and costs than children without asthma.},

	abstract = {Asthma is an important chronic childhood illness. A population-based surveillance program could measure the burden of illness, but first, the validity of an administrative diagnosis of asthma must be confirmed. The objective was to evaluate the accuracy of population-based outpatient administrative data in identifying children with asthma for the purpose of on-going asthma surveillance and research. Twenty-one primary care physician (PCP) clinics in Ontario participated. Patients under 18 yr old were categorized into three diagnosis categories according to administrative data diagnosis codes: asthma, asthma-related, and non-asthma. In each PCP clinic, for each diagnosis category, 10 charts were randomly selected for abstraction. A panel of experts (blind to the code) reviewed the abstracted charts and identified them as asthma or non-asthma. The reviewers’ diagnosis was considered the gold standard. The accuracy of the administrative data diagnosis coding was analyzed using the concepts of diagnostic test evaluation. Six hundred and thirty patient charts were abstracted and reviewed. Overall agreement between the diagnosis provided by expert chart review and the administrative data diagnosis code was 84.8\% (p {\textless} 0.001), and was 60.2\%, 94.8\% and 99.5\% for the asthma, asthma-related, and non-asthma categories, respectively. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity were 91.4\% and 82.9\%, respectively. Agreement between the administrative data diagnosis code and the PCP chart diagnosis was 99.4\% (p {\textless} 0.001). An administrative data diagnosis code of asthma is sensitive and specific for identifying asthma. By using the results of this study as a starting point, future research will create a cohort of children with asthma to be used for population-based surveillance and research.},

The Delphi technique is well suited as a method for consensus-building by using a series of questionnaires delivered using multiple iterations to collect data from a panel of selected subjects. Subject selection, time frames for conducting and completing a study, the possibility of low response rates, and unintentionally guiding feedback from the respondent group are areas which should be considered when designing and implementing a Delphi study.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To address the major methodological issues of reverse causation and selection bias in epidemiologic studies of antibiotic use in early life and the development of asthma, we undertook a cohort study of this association in a complete population of children.
METHODS: Using the health-care and prescription databases of Manitoba, Canada, this longitudinal study assessed the association between antibiotic prescription use during the first year of life and asthma at age 7 years in a 1995 birth cohort of 13,116 children.
RESULTS: Independent of well-known asthma risk factors, asthma was significantly more likely to develop in children who had received antibiotics in the first year of life at age 7 years. The association with asthma was observed for antibiotic use in non-respiratory tract infections (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.86; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 3.37). The risk of asthma was highest in children receiving more than four courses of antibiotics (adjusted OR, 1.46; 95\% CI, 1.14 to 1.88), especially among rural children, and in the absence of maternal asthma or a dog in the birth year. Broad-spectrum (BS) cephalosporin use was more common in these subpopulations of children.
CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic use in early life was associated with the development of childhood asthma, a risk that may be reduced by avoiding the use of BS cephalosporins.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of allergic diseases has been growing rapidly in industrial countries during recent decades. It is postulated that growing up with less microbial exposure may render the immune system susceptible to a T helper type 2 (Th2)-predominant allergic response-also known as the hygiene hypothesis. This review delineates recent epidemiological and experimental evidence for the hygiene hypothesis, and integrates this hypothesis into the association between early life exposure to antibiotics and the development of allergic diseases and asthma. Several retrospective or prospective epidemiological studies reveal that early exposure to antibiotics may be positively associated with the development of allergic diseases and asthma. However, the conclusion is inconsistent. Experimental studies show that antibiotics may induce the Th2-skewed response by suppressing the T helper type 1 (Th1) response through inhibition of Th1 cytokines and disruption of the natural course of infection, or by disturbing the microflora of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and therefore jeopardizing the establishment of oral tolerance and regulatory T cell immune responses. The hygiene hypothesis may not be the only explanation for the rapid increase in the prevalence of allergic diseases and asthma. Further epidemiological and experimental studies addressing the issue of the impact of environmental factors on the development of allergic diseases and the underlying mechanisms may unveil novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases in the future.},

	abstract = {Newborns adjust to the extrauterine environment by developing intestinal immune homeostasis. Appropriate initial bacterial colonization is necessary for adequate intestinal immune development. An environmental determinant of adequate colonization is breast milk. Although the full-term infant is developmentally capable of mounting an immune response, the effector immune component requires bacterial stimulation. Breast milk stimulates the proliferation of a well-balanced and diverse microbiota, which initially influences a switch from an intrauterine TH2 predominant to a TH1/TH2 balanced response and with activation of T-regulatory cells by breast milk-stimulated specific organisms (Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides). As an example of its effect, oligosaccharides in breast milk are fermented by colonic bacteria producing an acid milieu for bacterial proliferation. In addition, short-chain fatty acids in breast milk activate receptors on T-reg cells and bacterial genes, which preferentially mediate intestinal tight junction expression and anti-inflammation. Other components of breast milk (defensins, lactoferrin, etc.) inhibit pathogens and further contribute to microbiota composition. The breast milk influence on initial intestinal microbiota also prevents expression of immune-mediated diseases (asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes) later in life through a balanced initial immune response, underscoring the necessity of breastfeeding as the first source of nutrition.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary interventions as a means for atopy prevention attract great interest. Some studies in rural environments claimed an inverse association between consumption of farm-produced dairy products and the prevalence of allergic diseases, but current evidence is controversial.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether consumption of farm-produced products is associated with a lower prevalence of asthma and allergy when compared with shop-purchased products.
METHODS: Cross sectional multi-centre study (PARSIFAL) including 14,893 children aged 5-13 years from five European countries (2823 from farm families and 4606 attending Steiner Schools as well as 5440 farm reference and 2024 Steiner reference children). A detailed questionnaire including a dietary component was completed and allergen-specific IgE was measured in serum.
RESULTS: Farm milk consumption ever in life showed a statistically significant inverse association with asthma: covariate adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.74 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.88], rhinoconjunctivitis: aOR 0.56 (0.43-0.73) and sensitization to pollen and the food mix fx5 (cut-off level of {\textgreater}or=3.5 kU/L): aOR 0.67 (0.47-0.96) and aOR 0.42 (0.19-0.92), respectively, and sensitization to horse dander: aOR 0.50 (95\% CI 0.28-0.87). The associations were observed in all four subpopulations and independent of farm-related co-exposures. Other farm-produced products were not independently related to any allergy-related health outcome.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that consumption of farm milk may offer protection against asthma and allergy. A deepened understanding of the relevant protective components of farm milk and a better insight into the biological mechanisms underlying this association are warranted as a basis for the development of a safe product for prevention.},

OBJECTIVE: To explore the consistency between cases of asthma identified through physician billings compared with hospital discharge summaries.
METHODS: Rates of service use for asthma in 1998 among Montreal children aged one, four and eight years were estimated. Correspondence between the two databases (physician billing claims versus medical billing claims) were explored during three different time periods: the first day of hospitalization, during the entire hospital stay, and during the hospital stay plus a one-day margin before admission and after discharge ('hospital stay +/- 1 day').
RESULTS: During 1998, 7.6\% of Montreal children consulted a physician for asthma at least once and 0.6\% were hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of asthma. There were no contemporaneous physician billings for asthma 'in hospital' during hospital stay +/- 1 day for 22\% of hospitalizations in which asthma was the primary diagnosis recorded at discharge. Conversely, among children with a physician billing for asthma 'in hospital', 66\% were found to have a contemporaneous in-hospital record of a stay for 'asthma'.
CONCLUSIONS: Both databases of hospital and medical billing claims are useful for estimating rates of hospitalization for asthma in children. The potential for diagnostic imprecision is of concern, especially if capturing the exact number of uses is more important than establishing patterns of use.},

	abstract = {Asthma is an important chronic childhood illness. A population-based surveillance program could measure the burden of illness, but first, the validity of an administrative diagnosis of asthma must be confirmed. The objective was to evaluate the accuracy of population-based outpatient administrative data in identifying children with asthma for the purpose of on-going asthma surveillance and research. Twenty-one primary care physician (PCP) clinics in Ontario participated. Patients under 18 yr old were categorized into three diagnosis categories according to administrative data diagnosis codes: asthma, asthma-related, and non-asthma. In each PCP clinic, for each diagnosis category, 10 charts were randomly selected for abstraction. A panel of experts (blind to the code) reviewed the abstracted charts and identified them as asthma or non-asthma. The reviewers' diagnosis was considered the gold standard. The accuracy of the administrative data diagnosis coding was analyzed using the concepts of diagnostic test evaluation. Six hundred and thirty patient charts were abstracted and reviewed. Overall agreement between the diagnosis provided by expert chart review and the administrative data diagnosis code was 84.8\% (p {\textless} 0.001), and was 60.2\%, 94.8\% and 99.5\% for the asthma, asthma-related, and non-asthma categories, respectively. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity were 91.4\% and 82.9\%, respectively. Agreement between the administrative data diagnosis code and the PCP chart diagnosis was 99.4\% (p {\textless} 0.001). An administrative data diagnosis code of asthma is sensitive and specific for identifying asthma. By using the results of this study as a starting point, future research will create a cohort of children with asthma to be used for population-based surveillance and research.},

Two online surveys (coaches, n = 94; parents of athletes diagnosed with allergic disease, n = 90) were conducted. Binary regression was used to investigate determinants of risk perception. Asthma ranked seventh of 17 health hazards by coaches (23\% ranked as high) and parents (34\%), and determinants of risk included trigger knowledge, risk exposure, propensity for risk, indicators of trust, and socioeconomic variables (e.g., gender).

	abstract = {Objectives: A previous definition of adolescent asthma self-management was derived from interviews with clinicians/researchers and published literature; however, it did not incorporate perspectives of teens or parents. Therefore, we conducted in-depth interviews with teens and parents and synthesized present findings with the prior analysis to develop a more encompassing definition and model. Methods: Focal concepts were qualitatively extracted from 14-day self-management voice-diaries (n = 14) and 1-hour interviews (n = 42) with teens and parents (28 individuals) along with concepts found in the previous clinical/research oriented analysis. Conceptual structure and relationships were identified and key findings synthesized to develop a revised definition and model of adolescent asthma self-management. Results: There were two primary self-management constructs: processes of self-management and tasks of self-management. Self-management was defined as the iterative process of assessing, deciding, and responding to specific situations in order to achieve personally important outcomes. Clinically relevant asthma self-management tasks included monitoring asthma, managing active issues through pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic strategies, preventing future issues, and communicating with others as needed. Self-management processes were reciprocally influenced by intrapersonal factors (both cognitive and physical), interpersonal factors (family, social and physical environments), and personally relevant asthma and non-asthma outcomes. Conclusion: This is the first definition of asthma self-management incorporating teen, parent, clinician, and researcher perspectives, which suggests that self-management processes and behaviors are influenced by individually variable personal and interpersonal factors, and are driven by personally important outcomes. Clinicians and researchers should investigate teens' symptom perceptions, medication beliefs, current approaches to symptom management, relevant outcomes, and personal priorities.},

The model of pediatric asthma disparity presented is based on the conceptualization of health disparities as the result of a complex interaction of factors related to four main domains: the individual and family, the environment or context in which the child lives, the health-care system, and provider characteristics. Asthma disparities are discussed as they are reflected in the process of care (access and quality of treatment) and outcome (prevalence, morbidity, severity) experienced by Latino children. The potential mechanisms that may account for the asthma disparities documented as reflected by the conceptual model proposed are discussed. Finally, several suggestions for future research examining determinants that account for asthma disparities are examined.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of the use of prebiotics for the primary prevention of atopic dermatitis in The Netherlands. A model was constructed using decision analytical techniques. The model was developed to estimate the health economic impact of prebiotic preventive disease management of atopic dermatitis. Data sources used include published literature, clinical trials and official price/tariff lists and national population statistics. The comparator was no supplementation with prebiotics. The primary perspective for conducting the economic evaluation was based on the situation in The Netherlands in 2009. The results show that the use of prebiotics infant formula (IMMUNOFORTIS(®)) leads to an additional cost of € 51 and an increase in Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) of 0.108, when compared with no prebiotics. Consequently, the use of infant formula with a specific mixture of prebiotics results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of € 472. The sensitivity analyses show that the ICER remains in all analyses far below the threshold of € 20,000/QALY.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that the favourable health benefit of the use of a specific mixture of prebiotics results in positive short- and long-term health economic benefits. In addition, this study demonstrates that the use of infant formula with a specific mixture of prebiotics is a highly cost-effective way of preventing atopic dermatitis in The Netherlands.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies reported that infection by varicella zoster virus (VZV) may lead to delayed onset of asthma in children/adolescents. This information will likely alter the cost-effectiveness of the US. VZV vaccination program. We created a decision analysis model to estimate the costs and health-related effects of VZV 2-dose vaccination, assuming VZV infection delays asthma onset.
METHODS: The Markov model considered a birth cohort of 3,957,577 individuals entering the population from a societal perspective. We predicted the number of asthma/VZV cases, asthma-/VZV-related mortality and costs associated with asthma/VZV. Comparison arms included (1) VZV vaccination program without delayed asthma onset, (2) VZV vaccination program with delayed asthma onset and (3) no VZV vaccination program with delayed asthma onset. We considered delayed onset ranging from 3 to 12 years.
RESULTS: The vaccination program proved cost-effective without an assumed delay in asthma onset. When the vaccination and no-vaccination arms were compared assuming delayed asthma onset, vaccination remained less costly despite increased savings related to asthma without vaccination. With delayed asthma onset of 9 years post VZV infection, cost savings due to vaccination were \$914.09 million, with 9984 cases of asthma averted and 9 greater overall deaths with vaccination.
CONCLUSION: VZV vaccination program was less costly than the "no-vaccination" scenario, despite delayed onset of asthma post VZV infection. However, vaccination resulted in increased asthma morbidity and mortality. This adds to current evidence that VZV vaccination is cost-effective, and may alter asthma-related health-care outcomes. VZV's effect on asthma symptoms still needs further evaluation before firm conclusions can be reached.},

STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model built via TreeAge compared the outcome of asthma in a theoretical annual cohort of 480,000 children born to pregnant smokers through 18 years of life. Vitamin C supplementation (500 mg/day) with a standard prenatal vitamin was compared to a prenatal vitamin (60 mg/day). Model inputs were derived from the literature. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of assumptions.
RESULT: Additional vitamin C during pregnancy would prevent 1637 cases of asthma at the age of 18 per birth cohort of pregnant smokers. Vitamin C would reduce asthma-related childhood deaths and save \$31,420,800 in societal costs over 18 years per birth cohort.
CONCLUSION: Vitamin C supplementation in pregnant smokers is a safe and inexpensive intervention that may reduce the economic burden of pediatric asthma.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2288-11-150},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the rising number of asthma cases and the increasing costs of health care, prevention may be the best cure. Decisions regarding the implementation of prevention programmes in general and choosing between unifaceted and multifaceted strategies in particular are urgently needed. Existing trials on the primary prevention of asthma are, however, insufficient on their own to inform the decision of stakeholders regarding the cost-effectiveness of such prevention strategies. Decision analytic modelling synthesises available data for the cost-effectiveness evaluation of strategies in an explicit manner. Published reports on model development should provide the detail and transparency required to increase the acceptability of cost-effectiveness modelling. But, detail on the explicit steps and the involvement of experts in structuring a model is often unevenly reported. In this paper, we describe a procedure to structure and validate a model for the primary prevention of asthma in children.
METHODS: An expert panel was convened for round-table discussions to frame the cost-effectiveness research question and to select and structure a model. The model's structural validity, which indicates how well a model reflects the reality, was determined through descriptive and parallel validation. Descriptive validation was performed with the experts. Parallel validation qualitatively compared similarity between other published models with different decision problems.
RESULTS: The multidisciplinary input of experts helped to develop a decision-tree structure which compares the current situation with screening and prevention. The prevention was further divided between multifaceted and unifaceted approaches to analyse the differences. The clinical outcome was diagnosis of asthma. No similar model was found in the literature discussing the same decision problem. Structural validity in terms of descriptive validity was achieved with the experts and was supported by parallel validation.
CONCLUSIONS: A decision-tree model developed with experts in round-table discussions benefits from a systematic and transparent approach and the multidisciplinary contributions of the experts. Parallel validation provides a feasible alternative to validating novel models. The process of structuring and validating a model presented in this paper could be a useful guide to increase transparency, credibility, and acceptability of (future, novel) models when experts are involved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The outcome of childhood asthma in adults has been described in high-risk cohorts, but few population-based studies have reported the risk factors for persistence and relapse.
METHODS: We assessed children born from April 1972 through March 1973 in Dunedin, New Zealand, repeatedly from 9 to 26 years of age with questionnaires, pulmonary-function tests, bronchial-challenge testing, and allergy testing.
RESULTS: By the age of 26 years, 51.4 percent of 613 study members with complete respiratory data had reported wheezing at more than one assessment. Eighty-nine study members (14.5 percent) had wheezing that persisted from childhood to 26 years of age, whereas 168 (27.4 percent) had remission, but 76 (12.4 percent) subsequently relapsed by the age of 26. Sensitization to house dust mites predicted the persistence of wheezing (odds ratio, 2.41; P=0.001) and relapse (odds ratio, 2.18; P=0.01), as did airway hyperresponsiveness (odds ratio for persistence, 3.00; P{\textless}0.001; odds ratio for relapse, 3.03; P{\textless}0.001). Female sex predicted the persistence of wheezing (odds ratio, 1.71; P=0.03), as did smoking at the age of 21 years (odds ratio, 1.84; P=0.01). The earlier the age at onset, the greater the risk of relapse (odds ratio, 0.89 per year of increase in the age at onset; P{\textless}0.001). Pulmonary function was consistently lower in those with persistent wheezing than in those without persistent wheezing.
CONCLUSIONS: In an unselected birth cohort, more than one in four children had wheezing that persisted from childhood to adulthood or that relapsed after remission. The factors predicting persistence or relapse were sensitization to house dust mites, airway hyperresponsiveness, female sex, smoking, and early age at onset. These findings, together with persistently low lung function, suggest that outcomes in adult asthma may be determined primarily in early childhood.},

	abstract = {Objective
To assess the feasibility and value of simulating whole disease and treatment pathways within a single model to provide a common economic basis for informing resource allocation decisions.
Methods
A patient-level simulation model was developed with the intention of being capable of evaluating multiple topics within National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence’s colorectal cancer clinical guideline. The model simulates disease and treatment pathways from preclinical disease through to detection, diagnosis, adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatments, follow-up, curative/palliative treatments for metastases, supportive care, and eventual death. The model parameters were informed by meta-analyses, randomized trials, observational studies, health utility studies, audit data, costing sources, and expert opinion. Unobservable natural history parameters were calibrated against external data using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Economic analysis was undertaken using conventional cost-utility decision rules within each guideline topic and constrained maximization rules across multiple topics.
Results
Under usual processes for guideline development, piecewise economic modeling would have been used to evaluate between one and three topics. The Whole Disease Model was capable of evaluating 11 of 15 guideline topics, ranging from alternative diagnostic technologies through to treatments for metastatic disease. The constrained maximization analysis identified a configuration of colorectal services that is expected to maximize quality-adjusted life-year gains without exceeding current expenditure levels.
Conclusions
This study indicates that Whole Disease Model development is feasible and can allow for the economic analysis of most interventions across a disease service within a consistent conceptual and mathematical infrastructure. This disease-level modeling approach may be of particular value in providing an economic basis to support other clinical guidelines.},

Concerns regarding the accuracy of model outputs and hence the credibility of national reimbursement decisions are frequently raised. We propose a framework for developing reference models for specific diseases to inform economic evaluations of health technologies and their appraisal. The structure of a reference model reflects the natural history of the condition under study and defines the clinical events to be represented, the relationships between the events, and the effect of patient characteristics on the probability and timing of events.

	abstract = {Background. We report the development, validation, and implementation of an open-source population-based outcomes model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for Canada. Methods. Evaluation Platform in COPD (EPIC) is a discrete-event simulation model of Canadians 40 years of age or older. Three core features of EPIC are its open-population design (incorporating projections of future population growth, aging, and smoking trends), its incorporation of heterogeneity in lung function decline and burden of exacerbations, and its modeling of the natural history of COPD from inception. Multiple original data analyses, as well as values reported in the literature, were used to populate the model. Extensive face validity and internal and external validity evaluations were performed. Results. The model was internally validated on demographic projections, mortality rates, lung function trajectories, COPD exacerbations, costs and health state utility values, and stability of COPD prevalence over time within strata of risk factors. In external validation, it moderately overestimated the rate of overall exacerbations in 2 independent trials but generated consistent estimates of rate of severe exacerbations and mortality. Limitations. In its current version, EPIC does not consider uncertainty in the evidence. Several components such as additional (e.g., environmental and occupational) risk factors, treatment, symptoms, and comorbidity will have to be added in future iterations. Predictive validity of EPIC needs to be examined prospectively against future empirical studies. Conclusions. EPIC is the first multipurpose, open-source, outcome- and policy-focused model of COPD for Canada. Platforms of this type have the capacity to be iteratively updated to incorporate the latest evidence and to project the outcomes of many different scenarios within a consistent framework.},

	abstract = {Background
Prediction of future lung function will enable the identification of individuals at high risk of developing COPD, but the trajectory of lung function decline varies greatly among individuals. This study involved the development and validation of an individualized prediction model of lung function trajectory and risk of airflow limitation in the general population.
Methods
Data were obtained from the Framingham Offspring Cohort, which included 4,167 participants ≥ 20 years of age and who had ≥ 2 valid spirometry assessments. The primary outcome was prebronchodilator FEV1; the secondary outcome was the risk of airflow limitation (defined as FEV1/FVC less than the lower limit of normal). Mixed effects regression models were developed for individualized prediction, and a machine learning algorithm was used to determine essential predictors. The model was validated in two large, independent multicenter cohorts (N = 2,075 and 12,913, respectively).
Results
With 20 common predictors, the model explained 79\% of the variation in FEV1 decline in the derivation cohort. In two validation datasets, the model had low error in predicting FEV1 decline (root mean square error range, 0.18-0.22 L) and high discriminative power in predicting risk of airflow limitation (C-statistic range, 0.86-0.87). This model was implemented in a freely accessible website-based application, which allows prediction based on flexible sets of predictors (http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/FraminghamFEV1).
Conclusions
The individualized predictor is an accurate tool to predict long-term lung function trajectories and risk of airflow limitation in the general population. This model enables identifying individuals at higher risk of COPD, who can then be targeted for preventive therapies.},

	abstract = {Prediction models in health care use predictors to estimate for an individual the probability that a condition or disease is already present (diagnostic model) or will occur in the future (prognostic model). Publications on prediction models have become more common in recent years, and competing prediction models frequently exist for the same outcome or target population. Health care providers, guideline developers, and policymakers are often unsure which model to use or recommend, and in which persons or settings. Hence, systematic reviews of these studies are increasingly demanded, required, and performed. A key part of a systematic review of prediction models is examination of risk of bias and applicability to the intended population and setting. To help reviewers with this process, the authors developed PROBAST (Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool) for studies developing, validating, or updating (for example, extending) prediction models, both diagnostic and prognostic. PROBAST was developed through a consensus process involving a group of experts in the field. It includes 20 signaling questions across 4 domains (participants, predictors, outcome, and analysis). This explanation and elaboration document describes the rationale for including each domain and signaling question and guides researchers, reviewers, readers, and guideline developers in how to use them to assess risk of bias and applicability concerns. All concepts are illustrated with published examples across different topics. The latest version of the PROBAST checklist, accompanying documents, and filled-in examples can be downloaded from www.probast.org.},

	issn = {1097-0258},
	doi = {10.1002/sim.8682},
	abstract = {Missing data present challenges for development and real-world application of clinical prediction models. While these challenges have received considerable attention in the development setting, there is only sparse research on the handling of missing data in applied settings. The main unique feature of handling missing data in these settings is that missing data methods have to be performed for a single new individual, precluding direct application of mainstay methods used during model development. Correspondingly, we propose that it is desirable to perform model validation using missing data methods that transfer to practice in single new patients. This article compares existing and new methods to account for missing data for a new individual in the context of prediction. These methods are based on (i) submodels based on observed data only, (ii) marginalization over the missing variables, or (iii) imputation based on fully conditional specification (also known as chained equations). They were compared in an internal validation setting to highlight the use of missing data methods that transfer to practice while validating a model. As a reference, they were compared to the use of multiple imputation by chained equations in a set of test patients, because this has been used in validation studies in the past. The methods were evaluated in a simulation study where performance was measured by means of optimism corrected C-statistic and mean squared prediction error. Furthermore, they were applied in data from a large Dutch cohort of prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To develop and validate a new conceptual model (CM) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for use in disease progression and economic modeling. The CM identifies and describes qualitative associations between disease attributes, progression and outcomes.
METHODS: A literature review was performed to identify any published CMs or literature reporting the impact and association of COPD disease attributes with outcomes. After critical analysis of the literature, a Steering Group of experts from the disciplines of health economics, epidemiology and clinical medicine was convened to develop a draft CM, which was refined using a Delphi process. The refined CM was validated by testing for associations between attributes using data from the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE).
RESULTS: Disease progression attributes included in the final CM were history and occurrence of exacerbations, lung function, exercise capacity, signs and symptoms (cough, sputum, dyspnea), cardiovascular disease comorbidities, 'other' comorbidities (including depression), body composition (body mass index), fibrinogen as a biomarker, smoking and demographic characteristics (age, gender). Mortality and health-related quality of life were determined to be the most relevant final outcome measures for this model, intended to be the foundation of an economic model of COPD.
CONCLUSION: The CM is being used as the foundation for developing a new COPD model of disease progression and to provide a framework for the analysis of patient-level data. The CM is available as a reference for the implementation of further disease progression and economic models.},

Biologic therapies target specific inflammatory pathways involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, particularly in patients with an endotype driven by type 2 (T2) inflammation. In addition to anti-IgE therapy that has improved outcomes in allergic asthma for more than a decade, three anti–IL-5 biologics and one anti–IL-4R biologic have recently emerged as promising treatments for T2 asthma. These targeted therapies have been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations, improve lung function, reduce oral corticosteroid use, and improve quality of life in appropriately selected patients. In addition to the currently approved biologic agents, several biologics targeting upstream inflammatory mediators are in clinical trials, with possible approval on the horizon. This article reviews the mechanism of action, indications, expected benefits, and side effects of each of the currently approved biologics for severe uncontrolled asthma and discusses promising therapeutic targets for the future.},

Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine factors at baseline and over time, which were associated with PC20 at end of follow-up. A total of 7,748 methacholine challenges were analyzed. PC20 increased with age, with boys having greater increase after age 11 years than girls (P {\textless} 0.001). The divergence coincided with the mean age for Tanner stage 2. Postpubertal girls had greater airway responsiveness, even after adjustment for FEV1 and other potential confounders. Although multivariable regression analyses noted a variety of factors that influenced airway responsivness in both sexes, a history of hay fever (β= −0.30, P = 0.005), respiratory allergy (β= −0.32, P = 0.006), or recent inhaled corticosteroid usage (β= −0.18, P = 0.02) were associated with decrements in final log PC20 only in girls.Conclusions: Airway responsiveness (PC20) is more severe in the postpubertal female with asthma than in males. Although there are factors associated with airway responsiveness in both males and females, sex-specific factors may contribute to new insights into asthma pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {Asthma is the most common chronic condition in Western countries. Affecting 1 in 7 children and 1 in 12 adults, asthma is responsible for {\textgreater}350,000 avoidable deaths every year. While most children who develop symptoms of asthma are {\textless}5 years of age, the disease is frequently misdiagnosed or not suspected in infants and toddlers. In addition, the prevalence of asthma is different in males and females throughout their lifespan. While boys are more likely to develop asthma than girls, this pattern is reversed after puberty. This indicates that sex-specific factors, such as fluctuations in hormone levels, play a role in the disease’s pathogenesis. In this review, the authors discuss recent advances in diagnostic tools for asthma in both adults and children, as well as the influences of BMI, environmental exposures, socioeconomic factors, and sex hormones in the disease’s pathogenesis. The review will show that both experimental and epidemiological evidence suggest that circulating sex hormone levels are important contributors to asthma symptoms in post-pubertal females, while their role in males and children has not been yet established. In addition, the mechanisms associated with these hormonal influences on airway inflammation and hyper-reactivity have not been yet elucidated. The authors conclude that different factors affect asthma rates and severity in children and adults, and that more research needs to be conducted to identify the specific contributions of sex hormones. These will allow the development of more personalised asthma treatment strategies for men and women at different stages of life.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The economic impact of multimorbidity in severe or difficult-to-treat asthma has not been comprehensively investigated.
AIMS: To estimate the incremental healthcare costs of coexisting chronic conditions (comorbidities) in patients with severe asthma, compared with non-severe asthma and no asthma.
METHODS: Using health administrative data in British Columbia, Canada (1996-2016), we identified, based on the intensity of drug use and occurrence of exacerbations, individuals who experienced severe asthma in an incident year. We also constructed matched cohorts of individuals without an asthma diagnosis and those who had mild/dormant or moderate asthma (non-severe asthma) throughout their follow-up. Health service use records during follow-up were categorised into 16 major disease categories based on the International Classification of Diseases. Incremental costs (in 2016 Canadian Dollars, CAD\$1=US\$0.75=₤0.56=€0.68) were estimated as the adjusted difference in healthcare costs between individuals with severe asthma compared with those with non-severe asthma and non-asthma.
RESULTS: Relative to no asthma, incremental costs of severe asthma were \$2779 per person-year (95\% CI 2514 to 3045), with 54\% (\$1508) being attributed to comorbidities. Relative to non-severe asthma, severe asthma was associated with incremental costs of \$1922 per person-year (95\% CI 1670 to 2174), with 52\% (\$1003) being attributed to comorbidities. In both cases, the most costly comorbidity was respiratory conditions other than asthma (\$468 (17\%) and \$451 (23\%), respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities accounted for more than half of the incremental medical costs in patients with severe asthma. This highlights the importance of considering the burden of multimorbidity in evidence-informed decision making for patients with severe asthma.},

	abstract = {Asthma is a globally significant non-communicable disease with major public health consequences for both children and adults, including high morbidity, and mortality in severe cases. We have summarized the evidence on asthma trends, environmental determinants, and long-term impacts while comparing these epidemiological features across childhood asthma and adult asthma. While asthma incidence and prevalence are higher in children, morbidity, and mortality are higher in adults. Childhood asthma is more common in boys while adult asthma is more common in women, and the reversal of this sex difference in prevalence occurs around puberty suggesting sex hormones may play a role in the etiology of asthma. The global epidemic of asthma that has been observed in both children and adults is still continuing, especially in low to middle income countries, although it has subsided in some developed countries. As a heterogeneous disease, distinct asthma phenotypes, and endotypes need to be adequately characterized to develop more accurate and meaningful definitions for use in research and clinical settings. This may be facilitated by new clustering techniques such as latent class analysis, and computational phenotyping methods are being developed to retrieve information from electronic health records using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to assist in the early diagnosis of asthma. While some important environmental determinants that trigger asthma are well-established, more work is needed to define the role of environmental exposures in the development of asthma in both children and adults. There is increasing evidence that investigation into possible gene-by-environment and environment-by-environment interactions may help to better uncover the determinants of asthma. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further investigate the interrelationship between environmental and genetic determinants to identify high risk groups and key modifiable exposures. For children, asthma may impair airway development and reduce maximally attained lung function, and these lung function deficits may persist into adulthood without additional progressive loss. Adult asthma may accelerate lung function decline and increase the risk of fixed airflow obstruction, with the effect of early onset asthma being greater than late onset asthma. Therefore, in managing asthma, our focus going forward should be firmly on improving not only short-term symptoms, but also the long-term respiratory and other health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background
The rate of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) decline ("beta") is a marker of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease risk. The reduction in beta after quitting smoking is an upper limit for the reduction achievable from switching to novel nicotine delivery products. We review available evidence to estimate this reduction and quantify the relationship of smoking to beta.

Methods
Studies were identified, in healthy individuals or patients with respiratory disease, that provided data on beta over at least 2 years of follow-up, separately for those who gave up smoking and other smoking groups. Publications to June 2010 were considered. Independent beta estimates were derived for four main smoking groups: never smokers, ex-smokers (before baseline), quitters (during follow-up) and continuing smokers. Unweighted and inverse variance-weighted regression analyses compared betas in the smoking groups, and in continuing smokers by amount smoked, and estimated whether beta or beta differences between smoking groups varied by age, sex and other factors.

Results
Forty-seven studies had relevant data, 28 for both sexes and 19 for males. Sixteen studies started before 1970. Mean follow-up was 11 years. On the basis of weighted analysis of 303 betas for the four smoking groups, never smokers had a beta 10.8 mL/yr (95\% confidence interval (CI), 8.9 to 12.8) less than continuing smokers. Betas for ex-smokers were 12.4 mL/yr (95\% CI, 10.1 to 14.7) less than for continuing smokers, and for quitters, 8.5 mL/yr (95\% CI, 5.6 to 11.4) less. These betas were similar to that for never smokers. In continuing smokers, beta increased 0.33 mL/yr per cigarette/day. Beta differences between continuing smokers and those who gave up were greater in patients with respiratory disease or with reduced baseline lung function, but were not clearly related to age or sex.

Conclusion
The available data have numerous limitations, but clearly show that continuing smokers have a beta that is dose-related and over 10 mL/yr greater than in never smokers, ex-smokers or quitters. The greater decline in those with respiratory disease or reduced lung function is consistent with some smokers having a more rapid rate of FEV1 decline. These results help in designing studies comparing continuing smokers of conventional cigarettes and switchers to novel products.},

At the individual level, 2644 children from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) prospective birth cohort were examined for the association of systemic antibiotic use (at age {\textless}1 year) with the diagnosis of asthma (at age 5 years). In the same cohort, we did a mechanistic investigation of 917 children with available 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from faecal samples (at age ≤1 year), to assess how composition of the gut microbiota relates to antibiotic exposure and asthma incidence.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}At the population level between 2000 and 2014, asthma incidence in children (aged 1–4 years) showed an absolute decrease of 7·1 new diagnoses per 1000 children, from 27·3 (26·8–28·3) per 1000 children to 20·2 (19·5–20·8) per 1000 children (a relative decrease of 26·0\%). Reduction in incidence over the study period was associated with decreasing antibiotic use in infancy (age {\textless}1 year), from 1253·8 prescriptions (95\% CI 1219·3–1288·9) per 1000 infants to 489·1 (467·6–511·2) per 1000 infants (Spearman's \textit{r}=0·81; p{\textless}0·0001). Asthma incidence increased by 24\% with each 10\% increase in antibiotic prescribing (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1·24 [95\% CI 1·20–1·28]; p{\textless}0·0001). In the CHILD cohort, after excluding children who received antibiotics for respiratory symptoms, asthma diagnosis in childhood was associated with infant antibiotic use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2·15 [95\% CI 1·37–3·39]; p=0·0009), with a significant dose–response; 114 (5·2\%) of 2182 children unexposed to antibiotics had asthma by age 5 years, compared with 23 (8·1\%) of 284 exposed to one course, five (10·2\%) of 49 exposed to two courses, and six (17·6\%) of 34 exposed to three or more courses (aOR 1·44 [1·16–1·79]; p=0·0008). Increasing α-diversity of the gut microbiota, defined as an IQR increase (25th to 75th percentile) in the Chao1 index, at age 1 year was associated with a 32\% reduced risk of asthma at age 5 years (aOR for IQR increase 0·68 [0·46–0·99]; p=0·046). In a structural equation model, we found the gut microbiota at age 1 year, characterised by α-diversity, β-diversity, and amplicon sequence variants modified by antibiotic exposure, to be a significant mediator between outpatient antibiotic exposure in the first year of life and asthma diagnosis at age 5 years (β=0·08; p=0·027).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Our findings suggest that the reduction in the incidence of paediatric asthma observed in recent years might be an unexpected benefit of prudent antibiotic use during infancy, acting via preservation of the gut microbial community.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}British Columbia Ministry of Health, Pharmaceutical Services Branch; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Allergy, Genes and Environment (AllerGen) Network of Centres of Excellence; Genome Canada; and Genome British Columbia.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that is widespread throughout the US population and disproportionately affects children. This literature review aimed to identify recent information regarding the economic burden of pediatric asthma in the US. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Econlit, and PsycINFO databases and gray literature sources were searched from January 2012 to January 2018 to capture relevant publications. Publications reporting on healthcare resource utilization and/or healthcare costs of pediatric asthma were included (n = 8). Total direct costs of pediatric asthma were US\$5.92 billion in 2013. Average annual costs per child ranged from US\$3076 to US\$13612. Across studies, pharmacy (US\$1027–2120), inpatient (US\$337–2016) and outpatient (US\$1049–8039) costs were the primary contributors to healthcare costs. Inpatient and emergency department (ED) visits exerted a high economic burden. For instance, the national annual cost of asthma-related hospitalizations was estimated at US\$1.59 billion in 2009, while estimates of costs-per-hospitalization (2010) and charges-per-discharge (2009) were US\$3600 and US\$8406, respectively. The total cost of ED visits to Medicaid was estimated at US\$272 million in 2010. In a mixed-insurance population, ED cost estimates ranged from US\$152 to US\$172 annually per patient. Invariably, costs for children with asthma were significantly greater than for children without. Pediatric asthma imposes a significant economic burden to the US healthcare system. Children with asthma have significantly higher healthcare resource utilization and costs than children without asthma.},

Asthma diagnosis in preschool children has proven to be challenging due to the heterogeneity of the disease, the continuing development of the immune system in such a young population, and lack of diagnostic options such as lung function measurement. Early diagnosis and treatment of asthmatic symptoms will improve patients’ quality of life and help reduce disease morbidity. However, validated treatment options are scarce due to paucity of data and lack of conclusive studies in such a young patient population. Adjusting study design and endpoints to capture more reliable data with minimal risk of harm to patients is necessary. This thematic series review outlines the current position on preschool asthma, consolidates the current understanding of risk factors and diagnostic hurdles, and emphasizes the importance of early detection and management to help improve patients’ quality of life, both present and future.

The present Task Force proposes to use the terms episodic (viral) wheeze to describe children who wheeze intermittently and are well between episodes, and multiple-trigger wheeze for children who wheeze both during and outside discrete episodes. Investigations are only needed when in doubt about the diagnosis. Based on the limited evidence available, inhaled short-acting beta(2)-agonists by metered-dose inhaler/spacer combination are recommended for symptomatic relief. Educating parents regarding causative factors and treatment is useful. Exposure to tobacco smoke should be avoided; allergen avoidance may be considered when sensitisation has been established. Maintenance treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is recommended for multiple-trigger wheeze; benefits are often small. Montelukast is recommended for the treatment of episodic (viral) wheeze and can be started when symptoms of a viral cold develop. Given the large overlap in phenotypes, and the fact that patients can move from one phenotype to another, inhaled corticosteroids and montelukast may be considered on a trial basis in almost any preschool child with recurrent wheeze, but should be discontinued if there is no clear clinical benefit. Large well-designed randomised controlled trials with clear descriptions of patients are needed to improve the present recommendations on the treatment of these common syndromes.},

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and incidence of asthma in British Columbia (BC), Canada, and characterize associated health services utilization. Methods: We extracted data from provincial administrative hospitalization, medical services, and prescription drug databases for patients aged 5 to 55 years, during 1996 to 2009 having ≥270 MSP registration days and meeting asthma definition of: ≥1 hospital admissions with asthma as the principal diagnosis, or ≥2 physician visits for asthma as the principal diagnosis, or ≥3 asthma drug dispensings. Regression models were used to test change in asthma incidence and prevalence, and use of various health care services, such as physician and emergency department (ED) visits, and hospitalizations. Results: 379,950 patients met the study criteria. The prevalence (2.6\%) and incidence (0.7\%) of asthma was relatively stable over the study period. There was a decline in proportion of patients visiting family practitioners (FP) (OR 0.92; 95\% CI 0.90–0.94), specialists (OR 0.60; 95\% CI 0.58–0.62), using ED services (OR 0.31; 95\% CI 0.30–0.32) and hospitalizations (OR 0.34; 95\% CI 0.31–0.37). Regional differences were noted, with lower rates of FP and specialist visits and higher rates of ED visits for asthma in rural versus urban areas.Conclusions: In BC, the incidence and prevalence of asthma has remained stable over 14 years.

	abstract = {Objective
To examine temporal trends in the US incidence of childhood asthma hospitalizations, in-hospital mortality, mechanical ventilation use, and hospital charges between 2000 and 2009.
Study design
This was a serial, cross-sectional analysis of a nationally representative sample of children hospitalized with acute asthma. The Kids Inpatient Database was used to identify children aged {\textless}18 years with asthma by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 493.xx. Outcome measures were asthma hospitalization incidence, in-hospital mortality, mechanical ventilation use, and hospital charges. We examined temporal trends of each outcome, accounting for sampling weights. Hospital charges were adjusted for inflation to 2009 US dollars.
Results
The 4 separate years (2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009) of national discharge data included a total of 592 805 weighted discharges with asthma. Between 2000 and 2009, the rate of asthma hospitalization in US children decreased from 21.1 to 18.4 per 10 000 person-years (13\% decrease; Ptrend {\textless} .001). Mortality declined significantly after adjusting for confounders (OR for comparison of 2009 with 2000, 0.37; 95\% CI, 0.17-0.79). In contrast, there was an increase in the use of mechanical ventilation (from 0.8\% to 1.0\%, a 28\% increase; Ptrend {\textless} .001). Nationwide hospital charges also increased from \$1.27 billion to \$1.59 billion (26\% increase; Ptrend {\textless} .001); this increase was driven by a rise in the geometric mean of hospital charges per discharge, from \$5940 to \$8410 (42\% increase; Ptrend {\textless} .001).
Conclusion
Between 2000 and 2009, we found significant declines in asthma hospitalization and in-hospital mortality among US children. In contrast, mechanical ventilation use and hospital charges for asthma increased significantly over this same period.},

	abstract = {Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children, imposing a consistent burden on health system. In recent years, prevalence of asthma symptoms became globally increased in children and adolescents, particularly in Low-Middle Income Countries (LMICs). Host (genetics, atopy) and environmental factors (microbial exposure, exposure to passive smoking and air pollution), seemed to contribute to this trend. The increased prevalence observed in metropolitan areas with respect to rural ones and, overall, in industrialized countries, highlighted the role of air pollution in asthma inception. Asthma accounts for 1.1\% of the overall global estimate of “Disability-adjusted life years” (DALYs)/100,000 for all causes. Mortality in children is low and it decreased across Europe over recent years. Children from LMICs particularly suffer a disproportionately higher burden in terms of morbidity and mortality. Global asthma-related costs are high and are usually are classified into direct, indirect and intangible costs. Direct costs account for 50–80\% of the total costs. Asthma is one of the main causes of hospitalization which are particularly common in children aged {\textless} 5 years with a prevalence that has been increased during the last two decades, mostly in LMICs. Indirect costs are usually higher than in older patients, including both school and work-related losses. Intangible costs are unquantifiable, since they are related to impairment of quality of life, limitation of physical activities and study performance. The implementation of strategies aimed at early detect asthma thus providing access to the proper treatment has been shown to effectively reduce the burden of the disease.},

	abstract = {Background:
Asthma is the first cause of children hospitalization and need for emergency and impose high economic burden on the families and governments. We aimed to investigate the economic burden of pediatric asthma and its contribution to family health budget in Iran.

Methods:
Overall, 283 pediatric asthmatic patients, who referred to two tertiary pediatric referral centers in Tehran capital of Iran, included from 2010–2012. Direct and indirect asthma-related costs were recorded during one-year period. Data were statistically analyzed for finding association between the costs and factors that affect this cost (demographic variables, tobacco smoke exposure, control status of asthma and asthma concomitant diseases).

Results:
Ninety-two (32.5\%) females and 191(67.5\%) males with the age range of 1–16 yr old were included. We found the annual total pediatrics asthma related costs were 367.97±23.06 USD. The highest cost belonged to the medications (69\%) and the lowest one to the emergency (2\%). We noticed a significant increasing in boys’ total costs (P=0.011), and 7–11 yr old age group (P=0.018). In addition, we found significant association between total asthma costs and asthma control status (P=0.011).

Conclusion:
The presence of an asthmatic child can consume nearly half of the health budget of a family. Our results emphasis on improving asthma management programs, which leads to successful control status of the disease and reduction in economic burden of pediatric asthma.},

	abstract = {Background
Asthma, one of the most common chronic respiratory diseases, affects about 3 million Canadians. The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the published literature that reports on the clinical, economic, and humanistic burden of asthma in Canada.

Methods
A search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and EMCare databases was conducted to identify original research published between 2000 and 2011 on the burden of asthma in Canada. Controlled vocabulary with “asthma” as the main search concept was used. Searches were limited to articles written in English, involving human subjects and restricted to Canada. Articles were selected for inclusion based on predefined criteria like appropriate study design, disease state, and outcome measures. Key data elements, including year and type of research, number of study subjects, characteristics of study population, outcomes evaluated, results, and overall conclusions of the study, were abstracted and tabulated.

Results
Thirty-three of the 570 articles identified by the clinical and economic burden literature searches and 14 of the 309 articles identified by the humanistic burden literature searches met the requirements for inclusion in this review. The included studies highlighted the significant clinical burden of asthma and show high rates of healthcare resource utilization among asthma patients (hospitalizations, ED, physician visits, and prescription medication use). The economic burden is also high, with direct costs ranging from an average annual cost of \$366 to \$647 per patient and a total annual population-level cost ranging from {\textasciitilde} \$46 million in British Columbia to {\textasciitilde} \$141 million in Ontario. Indirect costs due to time loss from work, productivity loss, and functional impairment increase the overall burden. Although there is limited research on the humanistic burden of asthma, studies show a high (31\%-50\%) prevalence of psychological distress and diminished QoL among asthma patients relative to subjects without asthma.

Conclusions
As new therapies for asthma become available, economic evaluations and assessment of clinical and humanistic burden will become increasingly important. This report provides a comprehensive resource for health technology assessment that will assist decision making on asthma treatment selection and management guidelines in Canada.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Hospitalizations for ambulatory care-sensitive (ACS) conditions have been considered a marker for access to timely and effective primary care, but there are few pediatric studies. Our purpose was to examine socioeconomic disparities in ACS and non-ACS admissions among birth cohorts in a universal health insurance setting.
METHODS: We examined ACS and all hospitalizations of children born from 1993 to 2000 in Toronto, Canada, by birth year, calendar year, and socioeconomic status (SES). SES was evaluated by using quintiles of mean neighborhood income from the 1996 Canadian census. Cohort, age, and temporal effects were described for all admissions, ACS admissions, and specific ACS conditions. Attributable risk by SES was calculated by using rates for the highest and lowest SES quintiles.
RESULTS: Among 255,284 children born in Toronto during 1993-2001, ACS conditions were responsible for 28\% of hospitalizations during the first 2 years of life and close to half of admissions during the third year. Low income was associated with 50\% higher rates of ACS hospitalizations (relative risk [RR] = 1.50, 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 1.43-1.58), including asthma (RR = 1.69, 95\% CI 1.54-1.86) and bacterial pneumonia (RR = 1.59, 95\% CI 1.40-1.81), the leading causes of admission. Socioeconomic disparities in ACS and all admissions occurred in every cohort, every calendar year, and every age group.
CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between socioeconomic disadvantage and both ACS and all-cause hospitalization in children was large, consistent across many conditions, remained stable over time, and persisted up to 9 years of age. These effects occurred in a universal health insurance setting without direct financial barriers to physician or hospital care. The effect of SES on hospitalizations in children in our setting appears to be mediated by factors other than financial access to care.},

	abstract = {Our objective was to assess the cost of asthma care at the patient level in children from the perspectives of society, the Ontario Ministry of Health, and the patient. In this longitudinal evaluation, health service use data and costs were collected during telephone interviews at 1, 3, and 6 months with parents of 339 Ontario children with asthma. Direct costs were respiratory-related visits to healthcare providers, emergency rooms, hospital admissions, pulmonary function tests, prescription medications, devices, and out-of-pocket expenses. Indirect costs were parents' absences from work/usual activities and travel and waiting time. Hospital admissions accounted for 43\%, medications for 31\%, and parent productivity losses for 12\% of total costs from a societal perspective. Statistically significant predictors of higher total costs were worse symptoms, younger age group, and season of participation. Adjusted annual societal costs per patient in 1995 Canadian dollars varied from \$1,122 in children aged 4-14 years to \$1,386 in children under 4 years of age. From the Ministry of Health perspective, adjusted annual costs per patient were \$663 in children over 4 years and \$904 in younger children. Adjusted annual costs from the patient perspective were \$132 in children over 4 years and \$129 in children under 4 years. The rising incidence of pediatric asthma demands that greater attention be paid to the delivery of optimal care to this segment of the population. Appropriate methods must be used to analyze healthcare costs and the use of services in the midst of widespread healthcare reform. The quality of clinical and health policy decision-making may be enhanced by cost-of-illness estimates that are comprehensive, precise, and expressed from multiple perspectives.},

A population-based surveillance and research program based on health administrative data could measure and study the burden of asthma; however, the validity of a health administrative data diagnosis of asthma must first be confirmed.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of population-based provincial health administrative data in identifying adult patients with asthma for ongoing surveillance and research.
METHODS: Patients from randomly selected primary care practices were assigned to four categories according to their previous diagnoses: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, related respiratory conditions and nonasthma conditions. In each practice, 10 charts from each category were randomly selected, abstracted, then reviewed by a blinded expert panel who identified them as asthma or nonasthma. These reference standard diagnoses were then linked to the patients' provincial records and compared with health administrative algorithms designed to identify asthma. Analyses were performed using the concepts of diagnostic test evaluation.
RESULTS: A total of 518 charts, including 160 from individuals with asthma, were reviewed. The algorithm of two or more ambulatory care visits and/or one or more hospitalization(s) for asthma in two years had a sensitivity of 83.8\% (95\% CI 77.1\% to 89.1\%) and a specificity of 76.5\% (95\% CI 71.8\% to 80.8\%).
CONCLUSION: Definitions of adult asthma using health administrative data are sensitive and specific for identifying adults with asthma. Using these definitions, cohorts of adults with asthma for ongoing population-based surveillance and research can be developed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The nested case-control study is an efficient epidemiological design whereby a case-control approach is employed within an established cohort. The large number of recent prospective studies and randomized trials conducted in cardiology provide cohorts within which the nested case-control approach is increasingly used.
METHODS: This paper describes the design of the nested case-control study, and evaluates its role in cardiology by reviewing all such studies indexed in Medline from 1966 to 2000. The example of homocysteine is used to illustrate how discrepancies between results of nested case-control and case-control studies played an important role in the decisions and recommendations of national and international organizations.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven nested case-control studies in cardiology were reviewed. The number of studies per year has been increasing since the first publication in 1987. The majority (96\%) of studies evaluated potential risk factors for cardiovascular disease while the remainder evaluated drugs with cardiac adverse effects. In studies of homocysteine and coronary artery disease, nested case-control studies did not confirm the strong association suggested by early case-control studies that may have been influenced by bias (eg, selection, publication, or reverse causality). This led national and international organizations to advise against routine screening.
CONCLUSIONS: The nested case-control study is increasingly used to study causal relationships in cardiology. The large cohorts of cardiac patients created by prospective studies, clinical trials, and administrative databases should be exploited using this methodology to assess potential cardiac risk factors and other causal relationships that cannot be studied in randomized trials.},

This program was evaluated using data derived from a cohort study of mortality among workers employed in the nuclear weapons industry. Controls were selected for cases via incidence density sampling; an estimate of the exposure-mortality association was obtained via conditional logistic regression. After 100 iterations of this procedure, the average effect estimate was compared to the risk estimate obtained via proportional hazards regression. The same methods were used to evaluate a program for incidence density sampling that was proposed previously by Pearce in 1989.5 , Results: Relative risk estimates obtained from nested case-control analyses conducted using the incidence density sampling program reported in this paper are unbiased. In contrast, the program for incidence density sampling proposed by Pearce5 tended to produce biased relative risk estimates; the magnitude of bias increased with increasing numbers of controls selected per case. , Conclusions: The computer program described in this paper offers a simple approach to incidence density sampling for nested case-control analyses with exact matching on attained age and appropriate enumeration of the pool of eligible controls for each case. This method overcomes problems of bias inherent in a previously proposed program for incidence density sampling.},

	abstract = {A group of children with a past history of wheezing was randomly selected from the Melbourne community at the age of 7 years in 1964, and a further group of children with severe wheezing was selected from the same birth cohort at the age of 10 years. These subjects have been followed prospectively at 7-year intervals, with the last review in 1999, when their average age was 42 years. Eighty-seven percent of the original cohort who were still alive participated in the 1999 review. This study showed that the majority of children who had only a few episodes of wheezing associated with symptoms of a respiratory infection had a benign course, with many ceasing to wheeze by adult life. Most who continued with symptoms into adult life were little troubled by them. Conversely, those children with asthma mostly continued with significant wheezing into adult life, and the more troubled they were in childhood, the more likely symptoms continued. There was a loss in lung function by the age of 14 years in those with severe asthma, but the loss did not progress in adult life. The childhood asthma had been treated before the availability of inhaled steroids. There was no significant loss of lung function in those with milder symptoms.

	abstract = {Background: Phase Three of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) measured the global prevalence and severity of asthma symptoms in children.
Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 798 685 children aged 13–14 years from 233 centres in 97 countries, and 388 811 children aged 6–7 years from 144 centres in 61 countries, was conducted between 2000 and 2003 in {\textgreater}90\% of the centres.
Results: The prevalence of wheeze in the past 12 months (current wheeze) ranged from 0.8\% in Tibet (China) to 32.6\% in Wellington (New Zealand) in the 13–14 year olds, and from 2.4\% in Jodhpur (India) to 37.6\% in Costa Rica in the 6–7 year olds. The prevalence of symptoms of severe asthma, defined as ⩾4 attacks of wheeze or ⩾1 night per week sleep disturbance from wheeze or wheeze affecting speech in the past 12 months, ranged from 0.1\% in Pune (India) to 16\% in Costa Rica in the 13–14 year olds and from 0\% to 20.3\% in the same two centres, respectively, in the 6–7 year olds. Ecological economic analyses revealed a significant trend towards a higher prevalence of current wheeze in centres in higher income countries in both age groups, but this trend was reversed for the prevalence of severe symptoms among current wheezers, especially in the older age group.
Conclusion: Wide variations exist in the symptom prevalence of childhood asthma worldwide. Although asthma symptoms tend to be more prevalent in more affluent countries, they appear to be more severe in less affluent countries.},

	abstract = {The morphometry of the large conducting airways is presumed to have a strong effect on the regional deposition of inhaled aerosol particles. Nevertheless, sex-based differences have not been fully quantified and are still largely ignored in designing inhalation therapies. To this end, we retrospectively analyzed high-resolution computer-tomography scans for 185 individuals (90 women, 95 men) in the age range of 12−89 years to determine airway luminal areas, airway lengths and bifurcation angles. Only subjects free of chronic airway disease were considered. In men, luminal areas of the upper conducting airways were on the average {\textasciitilde} 30-50\% larger when compared to those in women, with the largest differences found in the trachea (289.72±54.25mm2 vs. 193.50±42.37mm2 for men/women respectively). The ratio of the largest luminal area in men to the smallest luminal area in women (in any given segment) ranged between 4.5 and 8.6, the largest differences being found in the lobar bronchi. Sex-based differences were minor in the case of bifurcation angles (e.g. average main bifurcation angle: 93.04±9.58o vs. 91.03±9.81o for men/women respectively), but large inter-subject variability was found irrespective of sex (e.g. range of main bifurcation angle: 65.04−122.01o vs. 69.46−113.94o for men/women respectively). Bronchial segments were shorter by {\textasciitilde} 5-20\% in women relative to men, the largest differences being located in the upper lobes. False discovery rate (FDR) analysis revealed statistically significant associations among morphometric measures of the right lung in women (but not in men) suggesting two phenotypes among women that we attribute to the smaller female thoracic volume.},

	abstract = {Airway luminal area is the major determinant of resistance to airflow in the tracheobronchial tree. Women may have smaller central conducting airways than men; however, previous evidence is confounded by an indirect assessment of airway geometry and by subjects with prior smoking history. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of sex on airway size in healthy nonsmokers. Using low-dose high-resolution computed tomography, we retrospectively assessed airway luminal area in healthy men (n = 51) and women (n = 73) of varying ages (19–86 yr). Subjects with a positive smoking history, cardiopulmonary disease, or a body mass index {\textgreater} 40 kg/m2 were excluded. Luminal areas of the trachea, right and left main bronchus, bronchus intermediate, left and right upper lobes, and the left lower lobe were analyzed at three discrete points. The luminal areas of the conducting airways were {\textasciitilde}26\%–35\% smaller in women. The trachea had the largest differences in luminal area between men and women (298 ± 47 vs. 195 ± 28 mm2 or 35\% smaller for men and women, respectively), whereas the left lower lobe had the smallest differences (57 ± 15 vs. 42 ± 9 mm2 or 26\% smaller for men and women, respectively). When a subset of subjects was matched for height, the sex differences in airway luminal area persisted, with women being {\textasciitilde}20\%–30\% smaller. With all subjects, there were modest relationships between height and airway luminal area (r = 0.73–0.53, P {\textless} 0.05). Although there was considerable overlap between sexes, the luminal areas of the large conducting airways were smaller in healthy women than in men.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Previous evidence for sex differences in airway size has been confounded by indirect measures and/or cohorts with significant smoking histories or pathologies. We found that central airways in healthy women were significantly smaller ({\textasciitilde}26\%–35\%) than men. The significant sex-difference in airway size was attenuated (20\%–30\% smaller) but preserved in a subset of subjects matched for height. Over a range of ages, healthy women have smaller central airways than men.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Children with lower birth weight are at increased risk of asthma symptoms.Objectives: To examine associations of fetal and infant growth with childhood lung function and asthma.Methods: This study was embedded in a population-based prospective cohort study of 5,635 children. Growth was estimated by repeated ultrasounds in the second and third trimesters, and measured at birth and at 3, 6, and 12 months. At age 10 years, spirometry was performed and asthma was assessed by parental questionnaire. Restricted and accelerated growth were defined as the growth percentile change between time periods less than −0.67 and more than 0.67 SD scores (SDSs), respectively. We applied multiple regression analyses, including conditional regression analyses, to account for correlations between repeated growth measures.Measurements and Main Results: Overall greater weight in the second and third trimesters, at birth, and at 12 months was associated with higher FEV1 and FVC (range of z-score difference, 0.04–0.08, per SDS increase in weight). Greater weight at 3 months was associated with lower FEV1/FVC and forced expiratory flow at 75\% of the pulmonary volume (FEF75\%) (z-score differences [95\% confidence interval]: −0.09 [−0.14 to −0.05] and −0.09 [−0.13 to −0.05] per SDS increase in weight, respectively). Restricted fetal weight growth was associated with lower childhood lung-function measures, partly depending on infant weight growth patterns (range of z-score difference, −0.25 to −0.13). Accelerated fetal weight growth was associated with higher FVC and lower FEV1/FVC only if followed by accelerated infant weight growth. Fetal and infant weight growth was not associated with childhood asthma.Conclusions: Both restricted fetal weight growth, partly depending on infant weight growth, and accelerated fetal and infant weight growth predispose children to lower lung function and a potential risk for respiratory diseases later in life.},

	abstract = {Asthma is a serious health problem throughout the world. During the past two decades, many scientific advances have improved our understanding of asthma and ability to manage and control it effectively. However, recommendations for asthma care need to be adapted to local conditions, resources and services. Since it was formed in 1993, the Global Initiative for Asthma, a network of individuals, organisations and public health officials, has played a leading role in disseminating information about the care of patients with asthma based on a process of continuous review of published scientific investigations. A comprehensive workshop report entitled “A Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention”, first published in 1995, has been widely adopted, translated and reproduced, and forms the basis for many national guidelines. The 2006 report contains important new themes. First, it asserts that “it is reasonable to expect that in most patients with asthma, control of the disease can and should be achieved and maintained,” and recommends a change in approach to asthma management, with asthma control, rather than asthma severity, being the focus of treatment decisions. The importance of the patient–care giver partnership and guided self-management, along with setting goals for treatment, are also emphasised.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The fall peak in childhood asthma exacerbations is thought to be related to an increase in viral infections and allergen exposure when children return to school. Whether the seasonality of asthma attacks among children from different geographic regions follows similar trends is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To compare seasonal trends in asthma exacerbations among school-age children who lived in different geographic locations, with different climates, within the United States.
METHODS: Hospital billing data bases were examined to determine the monthly number of school-age children who were hospitalized or treated in the emergency department (ED) for asthma exacerbations. Data from four cities within three states were compared. Climate data were obtained from archives of the National Climate Data Center, U.S. Department of Commerce.
RESULTS: An annual peak in asthma exacerbations was observed during the fall months (September through November) among children who lived in Charlottesville, Virginia, as well as throughout the state of Virginia. An increase in exacerbations, which peaked in November, was observed for exacerbations among children who lived in Tucson, Arizona, and Yuma, Arizona. In contrast, exacerbations among children from New Orleans, Louisiana, increased in September but remained elevated throughout the school year. Although there was annual variation in the frequency of exacerbations over time, the seasonal patterns observed remained similar within the locations from year to year. A nadir in the frequency of attacks was observed during the summer months in all the locations.
CONCLUSION: Seasonal peaks for asthma exacerbations varied among the children who lived in geographic locations with different climates, and were not restricted to the beginning of the school year.},

Rates were studied from January 1979 to December 1989.PATIENTS: The age groups studied were aged birth to four years, aged five to 14 years, 15 to 34 years, 35 to 49 years and 50 to 65 years. Sex differences in seasonal patterns in asthma hospitalization rates were also investigated.METHODS: The hospitalization data for asthma were obtained for the province of Saskatchewan from 1979 to 1989, inclusive. The time series was decomposed into its trend, seasonal and error component, using an additive model. Significance of the components was tested using a two-way ANOVA.RESULTS: Seasonal variations were observed in the monthly asthma hospitalization rates among Saskatchewan residents. Increases in asthma hospitalization rates were observed in the spring and fall months among children, in summer months among young adults aged 15 to 34 years and in winter months among the older age groups. Seasonal patterns in asthma hospitalization rates were similar for males and females in children and in adults aged 50 to 64 years. In young adults aged 15 to 34 years, increased asthma hospitalization rates were observed in spring months among men and in both spring and fall months among women. The 35- to 49-year-old men did not exhibit a statistically significant seasonal pattern, whereas the women did. No sex differences in seasonal patterns of asthma hospitalization rates were statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Seasonal patterns were observed in asthma hospitalization rates for residents of Saskatchewan. Asthma hospitalizations were greater in spring and fall seasons for children and in winter for the older adults. More studies are required to examine possible reasons for these seasonal differences in asthma hospitalizations.},

In more recent years, asthma trends have been less clear, with some studies suggesting that they are still rising and others suggesting that they have stabilized or decreased. A population-based cohort study was conducted to estimate asthma prevalence and incidence trends in one large Canadian province, Ontario. All individuals with asthma living in Ontario, a province of Canada with a multicultural population of approximately 12 million, were identified in universal, population health administrative databases by using a validated health administrative case definition of asthma. Annual asthma prevalence, incidence, and all-cause mortality rates were estimated from 1996 to 2005. During this time, the prevalence of asthma increased by 70.5\%. The age- and sex-standardized asthma prevalence increased from 8.5\% in 1996 to 13.3\% in 2005, a relative increase of 55.1\% (P {\textless} 0.0001). Asthma incidence rates increased in children by 30.0\% and were relatively stable in adults. Overall all-cause mortality decreased. Asthma prevalence in Ontario, Canada, has increased significantly. This is attributable, in part, to an increase in the incidence of asthma in children. Effective clinical and public health strategies are needed to prevent and manage asthma in the population.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Recent research suggests that the asthma epidemic observed in the 1980s and 1990s has stabilized. Changing trends in asthma may have an impact on the well-reported global phenomenon of the "asthma September peak." The 38th week of the year has been identified as the peak time for asthma exacerbations among children.
OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to examine the longitudinal trend of the September peak and to see if it changed over time, differed by age groups, or varied across different geographical regions.
METHODS: Monthly rates of asthma emergency department (ED) and physician outpatient visits were calculated using data provided by the Ontario Asthma Surveillance Information System from 2003 to 2013 for patients of all ages. The Ontario Asthma Surveillance Information System is a population-based surveillance system with over 2 million individuals with asthma. Age-specific rates were calculated using the prevalent asthma population-asthma individuals with at least one health service claim for asthma in the respective year-as the denominator. Rates were stratified by age group and region of residence. Spatial relationships within the province were tested to examine if the September peak was more prominent in certain regions of Ontario.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The highest September peak in ED visits was observed in 2005 for children aged 0-4 years and 5-9 years (18.35 and 8.11 per 1,000 asthma prevalence, respectively). The rate of asthma ED visits of all children was consistently highest in September; however, the spike became marginally less pronounced over time. Since 2005, there has been a 51.7\% decrease in the September asthma ED visit rate for all age groups. Monthly physician visits for all age groups usually peaked in October, roughly 4 weeks following the peak in ED visits. Analysis by residence showed that rates throughout Ontario were higher in September than in other months, suggesting that the spike was widespread rather than localized.
CONCLUSIONS: While the magnitude of the September peak has decreased over time, the asthma ED visit rate remains significantly higher in September than in other months. Physician visits are also highest in the fall. These findings stress the importance of empowering children and families to maintain good asthma control throughout the year, including hand washing, to minimize respiratory viral infections in September.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine trends in asthma hospitalisation and mortality rates from 2000 to 2014 in Kuwait according to sex, age and nationality.
METHODS: For this nationwide, retrospective observational study, data from hospital discharge records and death certificates listing asthma as the primary reason for hospitalisation or mortality were obtained from the National Center for Health Information database using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes J45 and J46. Trends in sex-adjusted, age-adjusted and nationality-adjusted hospitalisation and mortality rates were examined. Poisson regression models were applied to test for linear trends overtime and estimate adjusted rate ratios and 95\% CI.
RESULTS: During the 15-year study period, a total of 43 652 hospitalisations and 484 deaths due to asthma exacerbations were identified. The average annual adjusted rates of asthma hospitalisation and mortality were estimated to be 134.9 (95\% CI 131.8 to 138.1) and 2.1 (95\% CI 1.8 to 2.4) per 100 000 population, respectively. Hospitalisation rates decreased by 49.5\% in the total population (from 180.8 to 91.3 admissions per 100 000 population between 2000 and 2014, ptrend {\textless}0.001) and by 57.9\% in the age group of 5-44 years (from 77.3 to 32.5 admissions per 100 000 population, ptrend {\textless}0.001). Mortality rates decreased from 4.1 to 0.9 deaths per 100 000 population between 2000 and 2014 in the total population (77.6\% decrease, ptrend {\textless}0.001) and from 0.6 to 0.2 deaths per 100 000 population among those aged 5-44 years (61.9\% reduction, ptrend=0.005). Kuwaiti compared with non-Kuwaiti subjects had higher risk of asthma hospitalisation and mortality. Among children aged ≤19 years, the risk of hospitalisation was higher in boys compared with girls; however, among adults, women experienced more hospitalisations than men.
CONCLUSIONS: Asthma hospitalisation and mortality rates have substantially decreased between 2000 and 2014 in Kuwait, with persisting differences between genders, age groups and citizens versus non-citizens. The observed decreasing trends in Kuwait are in agreement with global trends.},

In large COPD populations the mean rate of FEV(1) decline in GOLD stages II and III is between 47 and 79 mL/year and 56 and 59 mL/year, respectively, and lower than 35 mL/year in GOLD stage IV. Few data on FEV(1) decline are available for GOLD stage I. Hence, the loss of lung function, assessed as expiratory airflow reduction, seems more accelerated and therefore more relevant in the initial phases of COPD.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The present study examines how trends in the prevalence of asthma during the past three decades associate with hospitalization and mortality during the same period.
METHODS: Altogether 54 320 subjects aged 25-74 years were examined in seven independent cross-sectional population surveys repeated every five years between 1982 and 2012 in Finland. The study protocol included a standardized questionnaire on self-reported asthma, smoking habits and other risk factors, and clinical measurements at the study site. Data on hospitalizations were obtained from the Care Register for Health Care, and data on mortality from the National Causes of Death register.
RESULTS: During the study, the prevalence of asthma increased - especially in women. In asthmatic compared with non-asthmatic subjects, hospitalization was significantly higher for all causes, respiratory causes, cardiovascular causes and lung cancer. In addition, particularly in asthmatic subjects, mean yearly hospital days in the 5-year periods after each survey diminished. In asthmatic subjects, the decrease in yearly all-cause hospital days was from 4.45 (between 1982 and 1987) to 1.11 (between 2012 and 2015) and in subjects without asthma the corresponding decrease was from 1.77 to 0.60 (p {\textless} 0.001). Similarly between 1982 and 2015, COPD hospitalization decreased more in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic subjects. Generally in the present study, all-cause mortality decreased between 1982 and 2015, though mortality in asthmatic subjects compared with non-asthmatics was higher from all causes, respiratory causes and lung cancer.
CONCLUSION: There was an increasing trend in the prevalence of asthma and a declining trend in hospitalization, especially in asthmatic subjects.},

	abstract = {Objective Although there are more studies showing higher asthma prevalence in urban rather than rural zones, few assessed asthma mortality by zone in children. The objective of this study is to compare asthma mortality rates (AMR) by zone of residence of Mexican children. Design Using national death certificate and population projections data, AMR were compared in children aged 0 to 14 years by gender, age group, and zone of residence from 1999 to 2016. AMR trends were calculated using Joinpoint regression. Results Of the 680 823 deaths, 2464 (0.36\%) were due to asthma. Asthma mortality was higher in rural (0.65\%) than urban (0.26\%) zones, P {\textless} .0001. Whole period AMR median was also higher in rural vs urban zones (0.6 vs 0.3, respectively), P {\textless} .05. The average annual percent change (AAPC) of AMR for the whole period was −5.1 in all children with a higher percent decrease in rural vs urban zones (girls' AAPC = −6.3 vs −4.1, respectively and boys' AAPC = −4.8 vs −4.2, respectively). AMR decreased in children aged 0 to 4 from both zones (rural's AAPC: girls = −7.9, boys = −5.2; urban's AAPC: girls = −5.1, boys = −5.4), P {\textless} .05. No trend was found in children aged 5 to 14. Conclusions Asthma mortality in Mexican children is higher in rural than urban zones. The decrease of mortality over time in early childhood is reassuring. More research is needed to determine reasons for higher mortality in rural Mexico and for the lack of a favorable decreasing trend in children aged 5 to 14 from both zones.},

PURPOSE: To identify the estimated recent prevalence and 10- year trends in asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis among the Korean population from 2008 to 2017.
METHODS: This nationwide cross-sectional survey (Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) over 10 years (2008-2017) examined representative samples of the Korean population (n=85,006) including 2,131 infants, 4,352 preschool children, 12,919 school-age children, 44,200 adults, and 21,404 elderly adults.
RESULTS: In the 2016 to 2017 population, the estimated prevalence of asthma was 0.9\% in infants, 2.3\% in preschool children, 4.1\% in school-age children, 2.3\% in adults, and 4.1\% in the elderly. The estimated prevalence of allergic rhinitis was 9.0\%, 20.2\%, 27.6\%, 17.1\%, and 6.9\%, respectively. The estimated prevalence of atopic dermatitis was 5.9\%, 11.3\%, 14.6\%, 3.9\%, and 1.6\%, respectively. Ten-year trends revealed a significant decrease in asthma prevalence in infants, preschool children, and the elderly. and in atopic dermatitis prevalence in infants and preschool children (P{\textless}0.05 for all trends). Furthermore, 10-year trends demonstrated a significant increase in allergic rhinitis prevalence in school-age children, adults, and the elderly, and in atopic dermatitis prevalence in school-age children and the elderly (P{\textless}0.05 for all trends).
CONCLUSION: These results improve our understanding of the age-stratified epidemiology of allergic diseases in Korea and suggest the need for the development of tailored and precise strategies to prevent allergic diseases in different age groups.},

Four population studies of asthma across at least two regions are described: European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS), the International Study of Wheezing in Infants (EISL), the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) and the World Health Survey (WHS). Two of these (ISAAC and WHS) covered all the regions of the world; each using its own standardised questionnaire-based methodology with cross-sectional study design, suitable for large populations. EISL (2005 and 2012) and ISAAC (1996–1997 and 2002–2003) have undertaken a second cross-sectional population survey from which trends are available: EISL in three centres in two countries; ISAAC 106 centres in 56 countries (13–14 year olds) and 66 centres in 37 countries (6–7 year olds). Key results from these studies are presented. Unfortunately, there is no new worldwide data outside of EISL since 2003. Global Burden of Disease estimates of asthma prevalence have varied greatly. Recent reliable worldwide data on asthma prevalence and trends is needed; the Global Asthma Network Phase I will provide this in 2021.

A retrospective analysis was carried out on cross-sectional data from the Finnish Defence Forces taken from call-up examinations of candidates for military conscription and examinations of conscripts discharged from service because of poor health. Roughly 1.7 million men aged 18‒19 years (98\% of men of conscription age) were examined from 1966 to 2017. A proportional but unknown number of young men were examined from 1926 to 1961.
The main outcome measures were asthma recorded at call-up examination as the main diagnosis in 1926‒2017 and any diagnosis in 1997‒2017, exemption or discharge from military service due to asthma, and allergic rhinitis and atopic eczema recorded as the main diagnosis in 1966‒2017 and any diagnosis in 1997‒2017.
During 1926–1961 the prevalence of asthma remained low at between 0.02\% and 0.08\%. A linear rise began between 1961 and 1966, with a 12-fold increase in the prevalence from 0.29\% in 1966 to 3.44\% in 2001. Thereafter, the prevalence of asthma as the main diagnosis stabilised but continued to increase to 5.19\% in 2017 if secondary diagnoses of asthma were included. Exemption rates from military service due to asthma have similarly increased but fluctuated more. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis increased from 0.06\% to 10.70\% and atopic eczema from 0.15\% to 2.90\% during the period 1966‒2017.
In Finland, an increase in asthma and allergic conditions among young men became evident in the mid-1960s. The increase slowed in the 2000s and may be levelling off in the 2020s.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: International time trends in asthma mortality have been strongly affected by changes in management and in particular drug treatments. However, little is known about how asthma mortality has changed over the past decade. In this study, we assessed these international trends.
METHODS: We collated age-standardised country-specific asthma mortality rates in the 5-34 year age group from the online WHO Mortality Database for 46 countries. To be included in the analysis, we specified that a country must have 10 years of complete data in the WHO Mortality Database between 1993 and 2012. In the absence of consistent and accurate asthma prevalence and prescribing data, we chose to use a locally weighted scatter plot smoother (LOESS) curve, weighted by the individual country population in the 5-34-year age group to show the global trends in asthma mortality rates with time.
FINDINGS: Of the 46 countries included in the analysis of asthma mortality, 36 were high-income countries, and 10 were middle-income countries. The LOESS estimate of the global asthma mortality rate was 0·44 deaths per 100 000 people (90\% CI 0·39-0·48) in 1993 and 0·19 deaths per 100 000 people (0·18-0·21) in 2006. Despite apparent further reductions in some countries and regions of the world, there was no appreciable change in global asthma mortality rates from 2006 through to 2012, when the LOESS estimate was also 0·19 deaths per 100 000 people (0·16-0·21).
INTERPRETATION: The trend for reduction in global asthma mortality observed since the late 1980s might have stalled, with no appreciable difference in a smoothed LOESS curve of asthma mortality from 2006 to 2012. Although better implementation of established management strategies that have been shown to reduce mortality risk is needed, to achieve a further substantive reduction in global asthma mortality novel strategies will also be required.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: There is no cure for asthma and as such, prevention remains a major goal. Given budget constraints, the value-for-money proposition of any asthma prevention strategy should be rigorously investigated before its widespread adoption, a task that is often performed through the use of decision-analytic models. The objective of this study was to solicit expert opinion to develop a concept map for a primary prevention policy model for asthma. Methods: We reviewed currently available decision-analytic models for asthma prevention. A steering committee of economic modelers, allergists and respirologists was then convened to draft a conceptual model of pediatric asthma. A modified Delphi method was followed to refine the conceptual model and achieve consensus among panel experts. Results: In the final conceptual model, asthma diagnosis was based upon lung function, atopy, and their symptoms, which in turn were affected by patient characteristics (sex, birth mode, ethnicity, lung growth, anthropometrics, rate of weight gain, genetics, and microbiome), family history, and environmental factors (breastfeeding, family/day-care size, pets, season, built environment, socio-economic status, diet, infection, and exposures). Conclusions: The conceptual model can inform the development and validation of a policy model for childhood asthma prevention.

	abstract = {Objective: Asthma exacerbations are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. Accurately identifying asthma patients at risk for exacerbation is essential. We sought to develop a risk prediction tool based on routinely collected data from electronic health records (EHRs).
Methods: From a repository of EHRs data, we extracted structured data for gender, race, ethnicity, smoking status, use of asthma medications, environmental allergy testing BMI status, and Asthma Control Test scores (ACT). A subgroup of this population of patients with asthma that had available prescription fill data was identified, which formed the primary population for analysis. Asthma exacerbation was defined as asthma-related hospitalization, urgent/emergent visit or oral steroid use over a 12-month period. Univariable and multivariable statistical analysis was completed to identify factors associated with exacerbation. We developed and tested a risk prediction model based on the multivariable analysis.
Results: We identified 37,675 patients with asthma. Of those, 1,787 patients with asthma and fill data were identified, and 979 (54.8\%) of them experienced an exacerbation. In the multivariable analysis, smoking (OR ¼ 1.69, CI: 1.08–2.64), allergy testing (OR ¼ 2.40, CI: 1.54–3.73), obesity (OR ¼ 1.66, CI: 1.29–2.12), and ACT score reflecting uncontrolled asthma (OR ¼ 1.66, CI: 1.10–2.29) were associated with increased risk of exacerbation. The areaunder-the-curve (AUC) of our model in a combined derivation and validation cohort was 0.67.
Conclusion: Despite use of rigorous methodology, we were unable to produce a predictive model with an acceptable degree of accuracy and AUC to be clinically useful.},

	abstract = {Background: As a major chronic disease, asthma causes many emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations each year. Predictive modeling is a key technology to prospectively identify high-risk asthmatic patients and enroll them in care management for preventive care to reduce future hospital encounters, including inpatient stays and ED visits. However, existing models for predicting hospital encounters in asthmatic patients are inaccurate. Usually, they miss over half of the patients who will incur future hospital encounters and incorrectly classify many others who will not. This makes it difficult to match the limited resources of care management to the patients who will incur future hospital encounters, increasing health care costs and degrading patient outcomes.
Objective: The goal of this study was to develop a more accurate model for predicting hospital encounters in asthmatic patients.
Methods: Secondary analysis of 334,564 data instances from Intermountain Healthcare from 2005 to 2018 was conducted to build a machine learning classification model to predict the hospital encounters for asthma in the following year in asthmatic patients. The patient cohort included all asthmatic patients who resided in Utah or Idaho and visited Intermountain Healthcare facilities during 2005 to 2018. A total of 235 candidate features were considered for model building.
Results: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.859 (95\% CI 0.846-0.871). When the cutoff threshold for conducting binary classification was set at the top 10.00\% (1926/19,256) of asthmatic patients with the highest predicted risk, the model reached an accuracy of 90.31\% (17,391/19,256; 95\% CI 89.86-90.70), a sensitivity of 53.7\% (436/812; 95\% CI 50.12-57.18), and a specificity of 91.93\% (16,955/18,444; 95\% CI 91.54-92.31). To steer future research on this topic, we pinpointed several potential improvements to our model.
Conclusions: Our model improves the state of the art for predicting hospital encounters for asthma in asthmatic patients. After further refinement, the model could be integrated into a decision support tool to guide asthma care management allocation.

	abstract = {Introduction  Asthma is a long-term condition with rapid onset worsening of symptoms (‘attacks’) which can be unpredictable and may prove fatal. Models predicting asthma attacks require high sensitivity to minimise mortality risk, and high specificity to avoid unnecessary prescribing of preventative medications that carry an associated risk of adverse events. We aim to create a risk score to predict asthma attacks in primary care using a statistical learning approach trained on routinely collected electronic health record data. Methods and analysis  We will employ machine-learning classifiers (naïve Bayes, support vector machines, and random forests) to create an asthma attack risk prediction model, using the Asthma Learning Health System (ALHS) study patient registry comprising 500 000 individuals across 75 Scottish general practices, with linked longitudinal primary care prescribing records, primary care Read codes, accident and emergency records, hospital admissions and deaths. Models will be compared on a partition of the dataset reserved for validation, and the final model will be tested in both an unseen partition of the derivation dataset and an external dataset from the Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Effectiveness II (SIVE II) study. Ethics and dissemination  Permissions for the ALHS project were obtained from the South East Scotland Research Ethics Committee 02 [16/SS/0130] and the Public Benefit and Privacy Panel for Health and Social Care (1516–0489). Permissions for the SIVE II project were obtained from the Privacy Advisory Committee (National Services NHS Scotland) [68/14] and the National Research Ethics Committee West Midlands–Edgbaston [15/WM/0035].

We propose to build on this by systematically applying various well-­known machine learning techniques to a large longitudinal deidentified primary care database, the Optimum Patient Care Research Database, and comparatively evaluate their performance with the existing logistic regression model and against each other. Machine learning algorithms vary in their predictive abilities based on the dataset and the approach to analysis employed.

Patients who have had actively treated clinician-­diagnosed asthma, aged 8–80 years and with 3 years of continuous data, from 2016 to 2018, will be selected. Risk factors will be obtained from the first year, while the next 2 years will form the outcome period, in which the primary endpoint will be the occurrence of an asthma attack.

However, efficient methods that can help identify personalized risk factors and make early predictions are lacking.
Objective: This study aims to use advanced deep learning models to better predict the risk of asthma exacerbations and to explore potential risk factors involved in progressive asthma.
Methods: We proposed a novel time-sensitive, attentive neural network to predict asthma exacerbation using clinical variables from large electronic health records. The clinical variables were collected from the Cerner Health Facts database between 1992 and 2015, including 31,433 adult patients with asthma. Interpretations on both patient and cohort levels were investigated based on the model parameters.
Results: The proposed model obtained an area under the curve value of 0.7003 through a five-fold cross-validation, which outperformed the baseline methods. The results also demonstrated that the addition of elapsed time embeddings considerably improved the prediction performance. Further analysis observed diverse distributions of contributing factors across patients as well as some possible cohort-level risk factors, which could be found supporting evidence from peer-reviewed literature such as respiratory diseases and esophageal reflux.
Conclusions: The proposed neural network model performed better than previous methods for the prediction of asthma exacerbation. We believe that personalized risk scores and analyses of contributing factors can help clinicians better assess the individual’s level of disease progression and afford the opportunity to adjust treatment, prevent exacerbation, and improve outcomes.},

	abstract = {Asthma attacks (exacerbations) are common, accounting for over 90 000 UK hospital admissions per annum. They kill nearly 1500 people per year in the UK, have significant associated direct and indirect costs and lead to accelerated and permanent loss of lung function. The recognition of asthma as a heterogeneous condition with multiple phenotypes has revolutionised the approach to the long-t­erm management of the condition, with greater emphasis on personalised treatment and the introduction of the treatable traits concept. In contrast asthma attacks are poorly defined and understood and our treatment approach consists of bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids. This review aims to explore the current limitations in the description, assessment and management of asthma attacks. We will outline the risk factors for attacks, strategies to modify this risk and describe the recognised characteristics of attacks as a first step towards the development of an approach for phenotyping and personalising the treatment of these critically important events. By doing this, we hope to gradually improve asthma attack treatment and reduce the adverse effects associated with recurrent courses of corticosteroids.},

Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases globally and is characterised by acute deteriorations. These exacerbations are largely preventable, so there is interest in using clinical prediction models in this area. The objective of this review was to identify studies which have developed such models, determine whether consistent and appropriate methodology was used and whether statistically reliable prognostic models exist.
Methods: We searched online databases MEDLINE (1948 onwards), CINAHL Plus (1937 onwards), The Cochrane Library, Web of Science (1898 onwards) and ClinicalTrials.gov, using index terms relating to asthma and prognosis. Data was extracted and assessment of quality was based on GRADE and an early version of PROBAST (Prediction study Risk of Bias Assessment Tool). A meta-analysis of the discrimination and calibration measures was carried out to determine overall performance across models.
Results: Ten unique prognostic models were identified. GRADE identified moderate risk of bias in two of the studies, but more detailed quality assessment via PROBAST highlighted that most models were developed using highly selected and small datasets, incompletely recorded predictors and outcomes, and incomplete methodology. None of the identified models modelled recurrent exacerbations, instead favouring either presence/absence of an event, or time to first or specified event. Preferred methodologies were logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression. The overall pooled c-statistic was 0.77 (95\% confidence interval 0.73 to 0.80), though individually some models performed no better than chance. The meta-analysis had an I2 value of 99.75\% indicating a high amount of heterogeneity between studies. The majority of studies were small and did not include internal or external validation, therefore the individual performance measures are likely to be optimistic.
Conclusions: Current prognostic models for asthma exacerbations are heterogeneous in methodology, but reported c-statistics suggest a clinically useful model could be created. Studies were consistent in lacking robust validation and in not modelling serial events. Further research is required with respect to incorporating recurrent events, and to externally validate tools in large representative populations to demonstrate the generalizability of published results.},

The review focused on diary variables, physiologic measurements, composite scores, biomarkers, quality of life questionnaires, and indirect measures.
Results: The Task Force developed new deﬁnitions for asthma control, severity, and exacerbations, based on current treatment principles and clinical and research relevance. In view of current knowledge about the multiple domains of asthma and asthma control, no single outcome measure can adequately assess asthma control. Its assessment in clinical trials and in clinical practice should include components relevant to both of the goals of asthma treatment, namely achievement of best possible clinical control and reduction of future risk of adverse outcomes. Recommendations are provided for the assessment of asthma control in clinical trials and clinical practice, both at baseline and in the assessment of treatment response.
Conclusions: The Task Force recommendations provide a basis for a multicomponent assessment of asthma by clinicians, researchers, and other relevant groups in the design, conduct, and evaluation of clinical trials, and in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis is a popular method for evaluating the performance of (bio)markers. However, the standard ROC curve does not directly connect marker performance to patient-related outcomes. Our aim was to fill this gap by proposing a conceptually similar graphical tool that carries information about the clinical uitility of markers.
Methods
We propose a novel graphical tool, the relative impact characteristic (RIC) curve, that depicts the trade-off between the population-level impact of treatment as a function of the size of the treated population for a given marker positivity rule (e.g., a threshold). We establish analogies between the ROC and the RIC curves around the interpretations of shape, slopes, and area under the curve and discuss parametric inference on RIC.
Results
As a case study, we used data from a clinical trial on preventive therapy for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We illustrate how the RIC curve can be constructed for a predication score and be interpreted in terms of a marker's ability toward concentrating treatment benefit in the population. We discuss hoe the RIC curve can be used to identify a threshold on the risk score based on the maximal acceptable number-needed-to-treat.
Conclusions
The RIC curve enables evaluation of markers in terms of their treatment-related clinical utility. Its analogies with the standard ROC analysis can facilitate its interpretation, bringing a population-based perspective to the activities of diverse marker development and evaluation teams.},

	abstract = {When data on treatment assignment, outcomes, and covariates from a randomized trial are available, a question of interest is to what extent covariates can be used to optimize treatment decisions. Statistical hypothesis testing of covariate-by-treatment interaction is ill-suited for this purpose. The application of decision theory results in treatment rules that compare the expected benefit of treatment given the patient's covariates against a treatment threshold. However, determining treatment threshold is often context-specific, and any given threshold might seem arbitrary when the overall capacity towards predicting treatment benefit is of concern. We propose the Concentration of Benefit index (Cb ), a threshold-free metric that quantifies the combined performance of covariates towards finding individuals who will benefit the most from treatment. The construct of the proposed index is comparing expected treatment outcomes with and without knowledge of covariates when one of a two randomly selected patients is to be treated. We show that the resulting index can also be expressed in terms of the integrated efficiency of individualized treatment decision over the entire range of treatment thresholds. We propose parametric and semiparametric estimators, the latter being suitable for out-of-sample validation and correction for optimism. We used data from a clinical trial to demonstrate the calculations in a step-by-step fashion. The proposed index has intuitive and theoretically sound interpretation and can be estimated with relative ease for a wide class of regression models. Beyond the conceptual developments, various aspects of estimation and inference for such a metric need to be pursued in future research. R code that implements the method for a variety of regression models is provided at (https://github.com/msadatsafavi/txBenefit).},

RESULTS: Nordic incidence of first hospital admission in 1999 was 2.17 per 1,000 children, readmission was noted in 16\% of the patients, mean LOS was 2.64 days, and total hospitalization cost was almost 14 million dollars.

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}In planning for upcoming mass vaccinations against COVID-19, many jurisdictions have proposed using primarily age-based rollout strategies, where the oldest are vaccinated first and the youngest last. In the wake of growing evidence that approved vaccines are effective at preventing not only adverse outcomes, but also infection (and hence transmission of SARS-CoV-2), we propose that such age-based rollouts are both less equitable and less effective than strategies that prioritize essential workers. We demonstrate that strategies that target essential workers earlier consistently outperform those that do not, and that prioritizing essential work-ers provides a significant level of indirect protection for older adults. This conclusion holds across numerous outcomes, including cases, hospitalizations, Long COVID, deaths and net monetary benefit, and over a range of possible values for the efficacy of vaccination against infection. Our analysis focuses on regimes where the pandemic continues to be controlled with distancing and other measures as vaccination proceeds, and where the vaccination strategy is expected to last for over the coming 6-8 months — for example British Columbia, Canada. In such a setting with a total population of 5M, vaccinating essential workers sooner is expected to prevent over 200,000 infections, over 600 deaths, and to produce a net monetary benefit of over \$500M.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Importance: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOC) across North America has been associated with concerns of increased COVID-19 transmission. Characterizing the distribution of VOCs can inform the development and implementation of policies and programs to address the prevention needs of disproportionately affected communities. Objective: We compared per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases (overall and VOC) from February 3, 2021 to March 10, 2021, across neighborhoods in the health regions of Toronto and Peel, Ontario, by proportion of the population working in essential services and income. Design: Descriptive epidemiological analysis, integrating COVID-19 surveillance and census data. Per-capita daily epidemic curves were generated using 7-days rolling averages for cases and deaths. Cumulative per-capita rates were determined using census-reported population of each neighbourhood. Setting: The study setting was the city of Toronto and the region of Peel (the City of Brampton, Mississauga, and Caledon), Canadas largest cities with a combined population of 4.3 million. This area of Canada has had one of the highest incident rates of COVID-19 throughout the pandemic. Participants: We used person-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 community cases (N=22,478) and census data for neighborhood-level attributes. Exposures: We stratified neighbourhood using dissemination areas which represent geographic areas of approximately 400-700 individuals, into tertiles by ranking the proportion of population in each neighbourhood working in essential services (health, trades, transport, equipment, manufacturing, utilities, sales, services, agriculture); and the per-person equivalent household income. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The primary outcomes were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases overall and VOC positives by neighbourhood. Results: During the study period, VOC cases emerged faster in groups with lowest income (growth rate 43.8\%, 34.6\% and 21.6\% by income tertile from lowest to highest), and most essential work (growth rate 18.4\%, 30.8\% and 50.8\% by tertile from lowest tertile of essential workers to highest tertile of essential workers). Conclusions and Relevance: The recent introduction of VOC in the large urban area of Toronto has disproportionately affected neighbourhoods with the most essential workers and lowest income levels. Notably, this is consistent with the increased burden of non-VOC COVID-19 cases suggesting shared risk factors. To date, restrictive public health strategies have been of limited impact in these communities suggesting the need for complementary and well-specified supportive strategies including vaccine prioritization to address disparities and overall incidence of both VOC and non-VOC COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The planned roll-out in the UK will involve vaccinating people in high-risk categories with their first dose immediately, and delivering the second dose 12 weeks later. Here, we provide both a further prespecified pooled analysis of trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and exploratory analyses of the impact on immunogenicity and efficacy of extending the interval between priming and booster doses. In addition, we show the immunogenicity and protection afforded by the first dose, before a booster dose has been offered.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We present data from three single-blind randomised controlled trials—one phase 1/2 study in the UK (COV001), one phase 2/3 study in the UK (COV002), and a phase 3 study in Brazil (COV003)—and one double-blind phase 1/2 study in South Africa (COV005). As previously described, individuals 18 years and older were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (5 × 10$^{\textrm{10}}$ viral particles) or a control vaccine or saline placebo. In the UK trial, a subset of participants received a lower dose (2·2 × 10$^{\textrm{10}}$ viral particles) of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 for the first dose. The primary outcome was virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease, defined as a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-positive swab combined with at least one qualifying symptom (fever ≥37·8°C, cough, shortness of breath, or anosmia or ageusia) more than 14 days after the second dose. Secondary efficacy analyses included cases occuring at least 22 days after the first dose. Antibody responses measured by immunoassay and by pseudovirus neutralisation were exploratory outcomes. All cases of COVID-19 with a NAAT-positive swab were adjudicated for inclusion in the analysis by a masked independent endpoint review committee. The primary analysis included all participants who were SARS-CoV-2 N protein seronegative at baseline, had had at least 14 days of follow-up after the second dose, and had no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection from NAAT swabs. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose. The four trials are registered at ISRCTN89951424 (COV003) and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606 (COV001), NCT04400838 (COV002), and NCT04444674 (COV005).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Between April 23 and Dec 6, 2020, 24 422 participants were recruited and vaccinated across the four studies, of whom 17 178 were included in the primary analysis (8597 receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 8581 receiving control vaccine). The data cutoff for these analyses was Dec 7, 2020. 332 NAAT-positive infections met the primary endpoint of symptomatic infection more than 14 days after the second dose. Overall vaccine efficacy more than 14 days after the second dose was 66·7\% (95\% CI 57·4–74·0), with 84 (1·0\%) cases in the 8597 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 248 (2·9\%) in the 8581 participants in the control group. There were no hospital admissions for COVID-19 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group after the initial 21-day exclusion period, and 15 in the control group. 108 (0·9\%) of 12 282 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 127 (1·1\%) of 11 962 participants in the control group had serious adverse events. There were seven deaths considered unrelated to vaccination (two in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group and five in the control group), including one COVID-19-related death in one participant in the control group. Exploratory analyses showed that vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 after vaccination was 76·0\% (59·3–85·9). Our modelling analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3-month period. Similarly, antibody levels were maintained during this period with minimal waning by day 90 (geometric mean ratio [GMR] 0·66 [95\% CI 0·59–0·74]). In the participants who received two standard doses, after the second dose, efficacy was higher in those with a longer prime-boost interval (vaccine efficacy 81·3\% [95\% CI 60·3–91·2] at ≥12 weeks) than in those with a short interval (vaccine efficacy 55·1\% [33·0–69·9] at {\textless}6 weeks). These observations are supported by immunogenicity data that showed binding antibody responses more than two-fold higher after an interval of 12 or more weeks compared with an interval of less than 6 weeks in those who were aged 18–55 years (GMR 2·32 [2·01–2·68]).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The results of this primary analysis of two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 were consistent with those seen in the interim analysis of the trials and confirm that the vaccine is efficacious, with results varying by dose interval in exploratory analyses. A 3-month dose interval might have advantages over a programme with a short dose interval for roll-out of a pandemic vaccine to protect the largest number of individuals in the population as early as possible when supplies are scarce, while also improving protection after receiving a second dose.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}UK Research and Innovation, National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR), The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, the Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation, the Lemann Foundation, Rede D'Or, the Brava and Telles Foundation, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley and South Midland's NIHR Clinical Research Network, and AstraZeneca.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Shelter-in-place mandates and closure of non-essential businesses have been central to COVID-19 response strategies including in Toronto, Canada. Approximately half of the working population in Canada are employed in occupations that do not allow for remote work suggesting potentially limited impact of some of the strategies proposed to mitigate COVID-19 acquisition and onward transmission risks and associated morbidity and mortality. We compared per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths from January 23, 2020 to January 24, 2021, across neighborhoods in Toronto by proportion of the population working in essential services. We used person-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 community cases (N=74,477) and deaths (N=2319), and census data for neighborhood-level attributes. Cumulative per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths were 3-fold and 2.5-fold higher, respectively, in neighborhoods with the highest versus lowest concentration of essential workers. Findings suggest that the population who continued to serve the essential needs of society throughout COVID-19 shouldered a disproportionate burden of transmission and deaths. Taken together, results signal the need for active intervention strategies to complement restrictive measures to optimize both the equity and effectiveness of COVID-19 responses.},

This historicallyimportant and still popular theory embodies the basic intuition thatwhat is best or right is whatever makes the world best in the future,because we cannot change the past, so worrying about the past is nomore useful than crying over spilled milk.  This general approach canbe applied at different levels to different normative properties ofdifferent kinds of things, but the most prominent example is probablyconsequentialism about the moral rightness of acts, which holds thatwhether an act is morally right depends only on the consequences ofthat act or of something related to that act, such as the motivebehind the act or a general rule requiring acts of the same kind.},

If not, there should be no moral objection to activeeuthanasia in circumstances where passive euthanasia is permissible;and there should be no objection to bombing innocent civilians wheredoing so will minimize the overall number of deaths in war. Thereshould, however, be an objection—indeed, an outcry—at ourfailure to prevent the deaths of millions of children in the thirdworld from malnutrition, dehydration, and measles.[2] Moreover, it seems that the question is pertinent to whetherconsequentialism is true, as consequentialists believe that doing harmis no worse than merely allowing harm while anti-consequentialists,almost universally, disagree. But is there a moral difference betweendoing harm and merely allowing harm? We might divide approaches tothis question into two broad kinds. First, those that attempt toanswer it without saying anything about the nature of the distinctioneither by use of examples (‘the contrast strategy.’) or byappealing to considerations that are purportedly independent of theprecise nature of distinction. And, second, those that analyze thedistinction in depth and try to show that its underlying naturedictates an answer to the moral question.},
