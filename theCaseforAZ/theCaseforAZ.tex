\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Background:} On March 29th, 2021, Canada's National Advisory
Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended against using the
AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in younger adults pending further review of
the risk for Vaccine-Induced Prothrombotic Immune Thrombocytopenia
(VIPIT). As a result, the province of British Columbia halted its
front-line workers vaccination program which used the AstraZeneca
vaccine. The province is expected to receive an additional 246,700 doses
of AstraZeneca vaccine through US and COVAX until April 11th, enough to
provide the first dose of vaccine to all unvaccinated front-line
workers. It is unclear whether the alternative, mRNA vaccines can be
immediately made available to front-line workers. We evaluated the harms
and benefits of delaying vaccination of front-line workers in BC.

\textbf{Methods:} We reviewed the latest available evidence and used
compartmental modelling to \emph{a)} compare the expected number of
deaths due to COVID-19 and VIPIT under the scenarios of immediately
continuing vaccination of front-line workers with the AstraZeneca
vaccine or delaying it in favour of mRNA vaccines, and \emph{b)} compare
the mortality risk of immediately receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine and
delaying vaccination at an individual risk level for different age
groups.

\textbf{Results:} We estimate that if British Columbia continues the
front-line worker vaccination program with the AstraZeneca vaccine, we
expect to see approximately 27,000 fewer cases of COVID-19, 500 fewer
hospitalizations, 80 fewer COVID-related deaths, and 1,400 fewer cases
of Long COVID, for an expected number of VIPIT-related deaths of 0.674
{[}95\% CI 0.414-0.997{]}. In areas of high transmission, projected risk
for COVID-related death from April 1st, to July 1st, 2021 was 4.63 per
100,000 in 60-69 years old, 2.49 per 100,000 in 50-59, 2.29 per 100,000
in 40-49 years old, 1.21 per 100,000 in 30-39 years old and 0 per
100,000 for 20-29 years old, compared to 0.26 (95\% CI 0.16-0.39) per
100,000 due to VIPIT.

\textbf{Conclusions:} The benefits of immediately continuing
immunization of front-line workers with AstraZeneca far outweigh the
risk both at a societal level and at an individual risk level for those
over 40, and those over 30 in high-risk areas.

\section{Background}\label{background}}

On March 29th, 2021, Canada's National Advisory Committee on
Immunization (NACI) recommended against using the AstraZeneca (AZ)
COVID-19 Vaccine for Canadians under the age of 55, due to concerns
about Vaccine-Induced Prothrombotic Immune Thrombocytopenia (VIPIT)
based on European reports \citep{naci_naci_2021}. On Match 18, 2021, the
European Medicines Agency estimated the incidence of VIPIT at
approximately 1 per 1,000,000 people vaccinated with the AZ vaccine
\citep{ema_covid-19_2021}. A higher estimated rate of 1 per 100,000 by
the Paul-Ehrlich Institut in Germany was published on March 19th
\citep{pei_covid-19_2021}. It was this higher rate reported by the
Paul-Ehrlich Institut that led NACI to recommend against using this
vaccine in adults under 55 years old \citep{naci_naci_2021}.

On April 1st, the UK Medicines \& Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency
(MHRA) updated its own previously reported data to report a total of 22
cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and 8 other clot-related events
from 18.1 million doses of the AZ vaccine (total incidence rate 1 in
600,000) \citep{mhra_coronavirus_2021}. On April 7th, MHRA concluded a
possible link between the AZ vaccine and extremely rare clotting events
and updated its data to report 79 UK cases of VIPIT (51 in women and 28
in men, all of them between 18 to 79 years old), including 44 cases of
CVST and 35 cases of thrombosis in other major veins (incidence rate 1
in 250,000)\citep{mhra_mhra_2021}.

On the same day, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC)
of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) concluded that VIPIT should be
listed as a very rare side effect of the AZ vaccine. PRAC noted that as
of March 22nd, a total of 86 cases of VIPIT (62 cases of CVST and 24
cases of splanchnic vein thrombosis) and 18 fatalities out of about 25
million vaccine doses were reported in EudraVigilance, the EU drug
safety database \citep{ema_astrazenecas_2021}. As of April 4th, 2021,
222 cases of VIPIT (169 cases of CVST and 53 cases of splanchnic vein
thrombosis) had been reported to EudraVigilance out of around 34 million
people who had received the AZ vaccine \citep{ema_astrazenecas_2021}.

BC had initially slated the AZ vaccine for outbreak control and
front-line workers vaccination program. On March 29th and following
NACI's recommendation, BC paused using the AZ vaccine for those under 60
and put the front-line workers vaccination program on hold.

Canadian provinces are expected to receive 1.5 million doses of the AZ
vaccine from the US and another 316,800 doses from the COVAX program
between now and April 11th \citep{government_of_canada_vaccines_2021}.
British Columbia expects to receive 246,700 doses from these two AZ
deliveries, enough to finish providing the first dose to all remaining
front-line workers.

The 300,690 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech and 105,900 doses of Moderna
vaccines expected within the same time frame are currently allocated for
the priority groups, indigenous population, and the currently ongoing
age-based vaccination campaign. The AZ vaccine was initially allocated
to front-line workers due to its easier handling and storage
requirements. If it is not logistically possible to switch the vaccine
allocation for above 55 years old age groups to the AZ vaccine and use
either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines for younger front-line
workers without delay, one might ask whether the benefits of immediately
deploying the AZ vaccine for front-line workers outweigh the rare but
serious risk for VIPIT.

Here, we provide a preliminary harm-benefit analysis of immediate
vaccination of all front-line workers with the AZ COVID-19 vaccine. We
based our analysis on mortality alone, and explore the risk both from a
societal and individual risk perspective.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

We assumed that BC allocates all 246,700 doses to front-line workers and
that there is enough uptake that BC is able to administer all these
doses. We compared immediately prioritizing of front-line workers for
the AZ vaccine (Scenario A) and delaying it until after those over 60
are fully vaccinated (Scenario B). For harm-benefit analysis from a
societal perspective, we compared expected number of deaths under each
vaccination strategy. We estimated the expected number of deaths due to
VIPIT as
\(E(death)_{VIPIT} = d \times P(VIPIT|vaccine) \times P(death|VIPIT, vaccine)\),
where \(d\) is the number of doses administered, \(P(VIPIT|vaccine)\) is
the risk of VIPIT after receiving each dose of the AZ vaccine, and
\(P(death|VIPIT, vaccine)\) is the case fatality for VIPIT. We did a
probabilistic analysis where enough data was available.

We assumed that each dose of the vaccine is independently associated
with the risk for VIPIT and that the risk of VIPIT is uniform across all
age groups. The most recent estimate for these probabilities by EMA, and
the estimates NACI used in its calculations are summarized in Table 1.

We estimated benefits of the AZ COVID-19 vaccine using a BC-specific
age-structured COVID-19 compartmental model by Mulberry and colleagues
that takes into account transmission, age-based contact structure,
front-line worker status, and rising \(R_0\) due to variants of concern
\citep{mulberry_vaccine_2021}. The model included susceptible, exposed,
infectious and recovered (SEIR) status and was based on the transmission
model by Bubar et al \citep{bubar_model-informed_2021}.

We ran the model from January 2021 to September 2021, which is when the
vaccination campaign is expected to conclude. To follow BC vaccination
strategy and case counts in the first three months of 2021, we held
\(R_0\) at 1.03 from January 1, 2021 for 70 days during which people
over 80 years old were eligible for vaccination. Age groups that were
offered vaccination were considered to be vaccinated at a steady pace
until everyone who is not vaccine-hesitant is vaccinated. Around the end
of March, we raised \(R_0\) to either 1.15 or 1.35 to account for
variants of concern gaining a foothold in BC and increased the pace of
the vaccination program. We validated these assumptions against observed
case counts.

\label{harm-param}
\end{table}

We assumed the first dose of the vaccine, regardless of the
manufacturer, to be, on average, 80\% effective against illness and 75\%
effective in preventing transmission. We further assume that all British
Columbians will be offered a first dose before July 1st, 2021, and a
second dose before the end of September 2021. We assumed the second dose
to have no effect other than prolonging the immunity acquired after the
first dose and posing a risk for VIPIT again. We did not consider the
risk for anaphylaxis, as all vaccines seem to have a similar risk in
that regard and the risk can be mitigated in the vaccination clinic.
Population estimates that were used in the model are summarized in Table
2. COVID-19 age-based case fatality and hospitalization rates were
obtained from BC CDC \citep{bccdc_british_2021} and Public Health Agency
of Canada (Tables:
13-26-0003)\citep{statistics_canada_preliminary_2021}. For seniors, we
used case fatality rates from January 1s, 2021 to April 9th, 2021 to
account for the immunity already acquired in long-term care homes. Rates
of Long COVID are Mulberry et al's estimations from data in Sudre et
al\citep{sudre_attributes_2021}. The proportion of essential workers by
age was taken from the COVID Speak survey per Mulberry et al
\citep{mulberry_vaccine_2021}. Population of BC in each group was
obtained from Statistics Canada \citep{statistics_canada_census_2017}.

For harm-benefit analysis at an individual risk level, we weighed the
probability of VIPIT-related death or
\(P(death)_{VIPIT} = P(vaccine) \times P(VIPIT|vaccine) \times P(death|VIPIT, vaccine)\),
against the average probability of contracting COVID-19 and dying from
it in each age groups, or
\(P(death)_{delayedVaccination} = P(COVID-19) \times P(death|COVID-19)\),
where \(P(vaccine)\) is the probability of getting the AZ vaccine
(assumed to be 1 here), and \(P(COVID-19)\) is the average probability
of contracting COVID-19 due to delayed vaccination from April 1st, 2021
to July 1st, 2020.

We used results from our compartmental model to project mortality risk
from COVID-19 due to delayed vaccination, and conducted sensitivity
analyses around model assumptions as outlined in Table 1.

All the analysis was performed using publicly-available data and code.

perspective}\label{harm-benefit-from-a-societal-perspective}}

EMA evidence as of April 4th, 2021 suggests that if we immediately offer
a first dose of the AZ vaccine to all eligible front-line workers in BC,
the expected number of VIPIT-related deaths by the end of June 2021 is
0.337 {[}95\% CI 0.206-0.496{]}, which means the probability of
observing at least one death in the same period is almost zero. Adding
the risk from the second dose, the expected number of VIPIT-related
deaths until the end of summer is 0.672 {[}95\% CI 0.411-0.997{]}. The
probability of observing at least one VIPIT-related death till the end
of the summer will be 24.7\%, and the probability of observing two
deaths would be almost zero.

NACI had based its analysis on the older and more pessimistic estimates
of a chance of 1 in 100,000 for VIPIT, and a mortality probability of
40\%, based on the data that was available in late March. In this
worst-case scenario analysis, the expected number of deaths in BC would
be 1 after the first dose is completed for all front-line workers and 2
after the second doses are delivered

\end{figure}

Figure 2 shows the progression of the vaccination campaign, as well as
projections for COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths under the
two scenarios of immediately prioritizing front-line workers (A) and
delaying their vaccination to after all those over 60 years of age are
offered a dose of the vaccine (B).

In our analysis, Scenario A led to 27175 fewer cases of COVID-19, 506
fewer hospitalizations, 87 fewer deaths, and 1462 fewer cases of Long
COVID, assuming \(R_0=1.35\). Figure 3 shows results for a wider range
of values for \(R_0\) and the effectiveness of the vaccine against
transmission, (\(v_e\)). Sensitivity analysis on vaccine effectiveness
against severe disease, \(v_p\), lead to similar results and conclusions
with a slight variation in number of outcomes. As \(v_p\) increased,
both the overall number of deaths and the number of deaths prevented
decreased.

\end{figure}

Figure 4 compares the risk of VIPIT-related mortality from 2 doses of
the AZ vaccine with the mortality risk from COVID-19 due to delayed
vaccination from April 1st to July 1st, 2021. We did the comparison
under two scenarios of an \(R_0\) of 1.15 or 1.35, to represent
different intensities for the third wave, or alternatively to represent
different geographical parts of the province during the third wave. We
calculated the mortality risk associated with VIPIT using both the
latest and most comprehensive evidence by EMA, and the worst-case
scenario using older evidence considered by NACI. Using EMA estimates,
we found that under both \(R_0\) scenarios, the mortality risk due to
COVID-19 to be much higher than the mortality risk associated with VIPIT
in those over 40. Mortality risk from COVID-19 was also higher for 30-39
age group that the mortality risk of VIPIT, although the difference was
negligible under \(R_0\) of 1.15 scenario. For the 20-29 age group, the
estimated mortality risk of vaccination with the AZ vaccine was higher
than that of COVID-19. Using the worst-case VIPIT estimates considered
by NACI, mortality risk from COVID-19 was considerably higher than that
of VIPIT for those over 60 in all areas and those over 40 in high-risk
areas (\(R_0=1.35\)).

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

In its analysis of AZ vaccine published on March 29th, 2021, NACI
weighed the risk of adverse events against the age-stratified risk of
mortality due to COVID-19, and concluded that the AZ vaccine should not
be used in adults under 55 years of age pending an overall
risk-assessment. Our analysis confirms that given the evidence available
in late March (a risk of 1 in 100,000 for VIPIT and a 40\% case
fatality) and the lower rates of transmission (i.e.~a lower \(R_0\)) at
that time, suspending the use of AZ vaccine in younger adults would have
been advisable. However, as of April 8th, 2021, the evidence from has
evolved and the EMA is now reporting a risk of 1 in 153,000 for VIPIT
and a 20\% case fatality. These latest estimates together with a new
wave of the disease have changed the harm-benefit landscape
considerably. In addition, the benefits of the AZ vaccine go beyond
preventing COVID-related mortality and include protection against more
common COVID complications in younger adults including severe disease,
hospitalizations, and Long COVID, as well as preventing onward
transmission of the virus, as evident in the recent sharp decline of
COVID-19 cases in the UK \citep{govuk_official_2021}.

The UK vaccination program started on December 8th with the
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and was complemented with the AZ vaccine since
January 4th. The number of confirmed daily COVID-19 cases in the UK has
plummeted from about 60,000 cases a day in early January 2021 when a
national lockdown was imposed and about 3\% of the population had
received at least one vaccine dose, to about 11,000 cases per day on
February 22, 2021 when a roadmap to easing the lockdown was announced,
to about 6000 cases per day on March 8, 2021 when the first phase of
easing public health restrictions was commenced
\citep{bbc_lockdown_2021} and has continuously declined since then to
just above 2589 cases as of April 10th, 2021, when 61\% of the UK
population had received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine
\citep{govuk_official_2021}.

In addition to the death aversion resulting from strict public health
measures, based on a recent analysis by Public Health England and the
University of Warwick, it has been estimated that as of March 31, 2021,
10,400 deaths have been avoided in the UK solely due to the direct
implementation of a nationwide vaccination program (indirect effects
were not measured; 87.5\% of these averted deaths were in the 80+ years
old age group, 11.5\% of them in 70-79, and 1\% in 60-69 years old age
group) \citep{public_health_england_impact_2021}. As about half of all
vaccine doses administered in the UK have been AZ vaccines, and based on
the estimated AZ vaccine efficacy of about 76\% against symptomatic
COVID-19 and 64\% against any NAAT-positive COVID-19 infection between
22 and 90 days after the first dose \citep{voysey_single-dose_2021}, and
real-world single-dose AZ vaccine effectiveness of about 60\% against
symptomatic COVID-19 and 80\% against COVID-19 hospitalization
\citep{public_health_england_1public_2021}, it is suggested that the AZ
vaccine is effective in reducing the overall burden of COVID-19.

Potential prevention of onward transmission with the AZ vaccine could be
especially critical for front-line workers during the current wave of
COVID cases. Of note, two recent studies from Toronto, Ontario have
shown that neighbourhoods with the highest proportion of front-line
workers had per capita COVID-19 case and death rates that were 2.5-3
folds higher than that of neighbourhoods with the lowest share of
front-line workers
\citep[\citet{rao_disproportionate_2021}]{chagla_characterizing_2021}.

Based on our analysis, immediately making the AZ vaccine available to
front-line workers is, assuming optimal uptake, net-beneficial by a wide
margin from a societal perspective. Our analysis from an individual risk
perspective shows that the risk of contracting COVID-19 and dying from
it due to delayed vaccination is considerably higher than the risk of
dying from VIPIT in those over 40, and also in those over 30 in
high-risk areas.

For a public health intervention to be deemed ethically acceptable,
being net-beneficial at a societal level is not enough in and of itself.
Not all interventions that are net-beneficial at a societal level are
net-beneficial for each member of the society, as those who carry the
burden of the risk of adverse events may not be the same people who reap
the benefits. We also recognize that many intuitively consider mortality
due a public health intervention in an otherwise healthy person to be
ethically worse than failing to protect someone from mortality due to
COVID-19. We believe that our conclusions hold regardless of the
position we take with respect to the \emph{doing vs.~allowing harm}
problem \citep{woollard_doing_2016}, as long as the expected benefit
outweighs the harm at a personal level, as seems to be the case for most
age groups in our study.

Our analysis was based on the assumption that immediate deployment of
alternative mRNA vaccines for front-line workers was not logistically
feasible. If feasible, and assuming that the effectiveness of mRNA
vaccines are 10-15\% higher than the AZ vaccine, offering mRNA vaccines
to front-line workers will be more in line with the principle of
reciprocity outlined in the BC COVID-19 Ethical Decision-Making
Framework \citep{bccdc_covid-19_2020}, and the more general principle of
justice in bioethics \citep{mccormick_principles_2021}.

Our findings are corroborated by the the recent recommendation of the UK
Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) that the benefits
of the AZ vaccine far outweigh the risk in 30 years old or older
recipients \citep{jcvi_jcvi_2021}.

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\section{Limitations}\label{limitations}}

Our analysis from an individual risk perspective was based on average
rates of COVID-19 and its related outcomes per age group. However, the
true risk within age groups is still heterogeneous and is affected by
many factors including but not limited to exposure, medical history,
work environment, and socioeconomic status.

Our analysis did not consider social aspects of vaccine roll-out such as
the effect of different roll-out strategies on uptake and vaccine
hesitancy, as they were beyond our expertise. However, we recognize that
each time a recommendation for vaccine safety is reversed, there might
be a penalty in public trust which could fuel vaccine hesitancy.
Potential for these effects should be weighed carefully by policy
makers.

Our analysis is based on currently available estimated rates of 1 in
million to 1 in 100,000 for VIPIT and might need correction should
higher rates of this complication be reported.

We have not considered potential sex differences in the risk for VIPIT.
Although cases identified to date have been predominantly female, it
remains unclear whether this was due to more females receiving the AZ
vaccine or due to an intrinsic difference in risk.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

Current evidence suggests that benefits of immediate prioritization of
front-line workers for vaccination with the AZ vaccine far outweigh the
risk, both at a societal and at a personal level for those over 40 years
of age, and those over 30 years of age in high-risk areas. Ultimately,
in dynamic situations like this where the evidence is uncertain and
evolving, vaccine roll-out decision are judgment calls that need to take
a complex network of medical, epidemiological, ethical, logistics, and
societal considerations into account.
